# CSS Inheritance

Some CSS styles applied to one element will be "inherited" by their child elements. These are usually styles which apply to the content of the elements, such as font family and color. Other properties, like margins, paddings and borders, don't get passed down to children.

> In English, the word **inherit** refers to something, like the color of your eyes, which you can receive from your parent. We use this to describe how "child" HTML elements can inherit styles from "parent" HTML elements.

We'll do two quick exercises to explore what gets inherited, what doesn't, and why.

> **Exercise (pair programming):** Now the person who is driving will create a `pull request` to the other person's repository. The other person will review the changes and merge them into his repository. The other person will now drive, after `pulling` the latest changes to his computer. Use just one CSS rule to set all of the text in the jumbotron to white. To do this, you'll need to use inheritance. Why do you think some styles, like text color, get inherited?
