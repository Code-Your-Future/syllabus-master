is the course material for Code Your Future, a\nnot-for-profit volunteer-run coding school for refugees and asylum seekers.\nDuring the course you will learn a technology stack that helps you build anything from a simple website to a powerful database-driven web application or even a mobile app! The six-months course starts with HTML/CSS then core JavaScript, backend development using NodeJS, and modern front-end development with React. We’ll complement the training with workshops on modern software methodologies and job interview practices etc...\nContributing\nPlease refer to our contributing guidelines for instructions on how to add or update a lesson.\nTo view this syllabus, visit https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master\n"},"week0/lesson0.html":{"url":"week0/lesson0.html","title":"Week 0","keywords":"","body":"\nLesson 0\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nCodeYourFuture\nWelcome task\n\n\nCodeYourFuture\n\nWho we are?\nWhat we learn?\nRead this Technology Survey from StackOverflow. Pay particular attention to the technologies we'll be teaching you (JavaScript, React, NodeJS)\n\n\nHouse Rules\nHow we work?\nHow we treat each other?\n\n\nStandup\n\nWelcome!\nWelcome to CodeYourFuture and to the world of Web Development! Now that you have built\na website in CodePen and learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it's time to learn about\nthe tools that web developers use in their everyday job. These tools will be used during\nthe course, so it is important that you become familiarised with them.\nIn order to get started, we would like you to try to complete a task at home: move your\nCodePen website to a web address under https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name.\nIn the process, you will learn how to store your code outside CodePen's website, in a location\nwhere other developers can make changes to it and view a history of all the updates that\nyou have made.\nIf you wish to learn more about the concepts behind the steps we are suggesting below,\nplease read the rest of this document.\nAnd remember: it's ok if you are stuck and don't know how to continue. At any point, please\nask for a mentor's help. We will cover these steps again in the lesson, and will explain\nthem in more detail.\nHow to move your website to Github.io\n\nExport your website as a zip from CodePen. Help >\nExtract the contents of the zip file to a folder in your computer. Keep note of the\nlocation of this folder.\nRead about the terminal.\nRead about git.\nInstall Git.\nPut the contents of the zip folder in a Gitub repository. How does Github work? (30min) >\nYou should now have a page with your code under http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.\nThis is a view of your code, and you should see a list of your files, including an index.html.\nNow all that remains is to publish your website! Still under http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name,\nfind the settings icon in the top right corner.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFind the section named \"Github Pages\" and select \"master branch\" in source, then hit\n\"Save\".\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWait a few minutes, then refresh the page and come back to the Github Pages section.\nYou should see a green bar saying \"Your site is published at http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name\".\nClick the link, verify that your website is there, then share it with your CYF class!\n\nHomework\n\nIf you have not yet moved your website from CodePen to Github, do it now.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.\nIt allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\nExtract from Git Pro book\n\nThis answer on StackOverflow by si618 explains very well why we use Version Control.\nSo what is Git?

Tie into the idea of how in a program these would be the ‘tools’ required for an activity and how for our sandwich making task the items we have listed previously are our classes\n\n\nNow that we have all of the tools we need to make a sandwich ask the students to shout out what they think the first step or instruction is:\nWrite the instruction out on the screen and ask the students which object would be needed to carry out that instruction\nCopy the instruction and place it under the object that the students have decided is responsible for it and introduce the idea of methods\nContinue asking the students for instructions and listing them under the objects that would be responsible for them (in the case where two objects are required to carry out an instruction try and break it down further with the students until only one object is responsible for any one instruction – could be a good way to introduce the idea of how specific you need to be in programming and the concepts that are detailed in the source example of this exercise)\n\n\nOnce the students are satisfied with the instructions take the best formed class and ask the students to come up with a one word summary for each instruction that is has. Explain the benefits of well named methods in programming and (maybe?) touch on naming conventions.\n\nGetting started with JavaScript\nWe will spend most of this lesson in Codepen. To get started, go to codepen.io/pen/ to create a new Pen. On the bottom left, click the \"Console\" button to open the console.\n\nYou can place your cursor right behind the > sign. Type a simple expression, such as 2 + 2 and hit enter. You will see expression, as well as its result, in the window above.\n\nYou will be able to follow most of this session along just entering expressions in the console like this.\nVariables and assignments\nFor an expression or a value to be of any use to us, we need to store it in a variable.\nVariables have a name (identifier) that we can use to refer to a value. You can assign a value to a variable with the following statement:\nvar x = 3;\n^   ^ ^ ^\n|   | | value\n|   | assignment operator\n|   identifier\ndeclaration statement\nLet’s break this statement down:\n\nvar: With the var statement we tell the JavaScript engine that x is now a variable\nx: The variable name/identifier. It can be short or long, but must not contain spaces and must not start with a number.\n=: The equal sign is the assigmnent operator\n3: The value that we assign to the variable. This can be any number, string or boolean, or any more complex data type that we will introduce later. You can also use an existing variable here.\n;: THe semicolon is not strictly needed, but is generally used to terminate a statement.\n\nNow you can use the identifier instead of the actual value in an expression:\nx + x, x * x, console.log(x)\nSimple data types & Expressions\nNumbers\nLet’s start with something seemingly simple - numbers. Here are some:\n1\n15\n3195803798\n1.4\n0.0000005\n0\n-23\n\nYou will see that there are whole numbers (no decimal point) and real numbers (decimal point), which in JavaScript are so-called “floating point” numbers. Numbers can be positive or negative and they support all the basic math operators that you would expect:\n2 + 2 // 4\n2 - 5 // -3\n2 * 3 // 6\n10 / 2 // 5\n3 * -2 // -6\n\nOperators have the same precedence as in algebra: * and / have higher precedence than + and -.\n\nTODO: Do math exercise\nTODO: What about Infinity, Math.PI, IEEE floating point bullshit, NaN\n\nStrings\nStrings represent any sort of text. They are delimited by single quotes (') or double quotes (”) and can be of any length.\n'' // empty string\n\"\" // empty string\n'Hello'\n'I am learning JavaScript'\n'It\\'s been a great journey so far!'\n\"Double quotes work as well\"\n\n\nIf you need single or double quotes inside the string, you need to “escape” them by putting a backslash in front of them. If you don’t do this, the JavaScript engine will think the string ends here, because it encounters a quote.\n\nThe most common operation on strings is to append one string to another. This is called string concatenation. It’s achieved by the plus (+) operator:\n\"Hello\" + \"World\" // \"HelloWorld\"\n\n\nTODO: Introduce string concatenation\nTODO: What about basic string functions, like substr, replace etc?\n\nBooleans\nBooleans are a data type that can only have two values: true and false.\nLike numbers, they can be combined using operators, but there are different operators for booleans (analoguous to Boolean algebra). The most important ones are:\n\n! (NOT), which negates a value:!true // false\n!false // true\n\n\n&& (AND), which is only true if both operands are true:false && false // false\ntrue && false // false\nfalse && true // false\ntrue && true // true\n\n\n|| (OR), which is true if at least one of the operands is true:false || false // false\ntrue || false // true\nfalse || true // true\ntrue || true // true\n\n\n\nTODO: When to introduce truthiness and falsiness? Probably in comparisons?\n\n\nExercise: Put simple mathematical expressions into the console: 2 * 2, 2 + 2, 5 * 7 - 13\nExercise: Calculate the area of a circle (r * r * pi). Do a quick Google search on how to use PI in JavaScript.\nSee what happens when you \"add\" two strings together\nResearch the JS Math library. sqrt, floor, ceil, round\nWrite an expression that outputs the percentage of students who are female. Make it so it outputs it as 58%, and make sure you use the actual numbers of women and the total number of students.\nSolution: console.log(Math.round(7 / 17 * 100) + \"%\");\n\nFrom REPL to console.log\n\nSingle expressions are not very useful, you want to write applications\nMore than one statement? Move it to the JS box in Codepen\nNow you don't get any immediate feedback\nUse console.log to print to the console: console.log(3 + 3);\nWrite statements below each other\n\n\nTHOUGHT: Codepen does not have a \"run\" button, so it's quite intransparent when it actually re-runs a program. Maybe a different tool is better? A simple jsbin configuration, maybe?\n\n"},"html-css/":{"url":"html-css/","title":"HTML/CSS","keywords":"","body":"HTML & CSS\nExample structure:\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\n\n\n\n\n1\nSemantic HTML tags  CSS Selectors  CSS Cascades  Pseudo Classes  Box model\n\n\n2\nResponsive web design  Media queries  Content Layouts\n\n\n3\nDesign frameworks  Naming patters  Forms  CSS processors\n\n\n\n"},"html-css/semantic-tags.html":{"url":"html-css/semantic-tags.html","title":"Semantic HTML tags","keywords":"","body":"Semantic HTML tags\nWhat makes a web page?\n\nSeparation of Concerns: In computer science, separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern.

Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.\n\nSemantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look.

It also allows the core design elements to be changed easily. For example, if all the buttons in your website use the same CSS class, you can change their appearance simply by editing one rule.\nThe BBC's Global Experience Language is a design framework.

But our other two types of class names share the same naming pattern: .card-inverted and .card-block.\nThe Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) naming pattern is an attempt to overcome this. It introduces separate naming structures for all three types of class names.\n\nThe object is called a \"Block\": .card.\nThe sub-objects are called \"Elements\" and are written with 2 underscores: .card__block, .card__title and .card__text.\nThe modifier is written with 2 dashes as: .card--inverted.\n\nIf we changed our Card example to use BEM syntax, it would look like this:\n\n    \n        Card title\n        Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n    \n\n\n\"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things\" - Phil Karlton\n\nOne of the goals in a naming pattern is to communicate purpose.\n"},"html-css/forms.html":{"url":"html-css/forms.html","title":"Forms","keywords":"","body":"HTML Forms\nForms provide tools for visitors to your webpage to interact by entering details, making selections or performing other actions.

So far we have been logging the same thing every time we run the code, but what if we want to log according to different conditions? In programming there is something called an \"if/else statement\". It tests conditions, and will perform different actions based on the outcome of these tests.\nThe structure of an if/else statement in JavaScript is as follows:\nif (condition) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nIt basically translates to \"if this condition is true, do this - or else do something else\".\nTry it out\nWhat if we want to console.log() \"Hello world!\" if we're feeling happy, and something else if we're sad?\nLet's define a variable called isHappy, and assign it a boolean value of true or false (depending on how happy you're feeling).\nvar isHappy = true;\n\nThen let's write our if/else statement. In our condition, we want to test if the variable isHappy is equal to true. Note that in JavaScript, to test if two things are equal you need to use a triple equals (===) rather than just one (=).\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nNow let's add in what will happen if the conditions are met.

If it is even, it will print the string 'even', and if it is odd, it will print 'odd'.\nFor this challenge, you might find it useful to use the \"modulo\" operator, which looks like this: %. The modulo operator finds the remainder after division of one number by another. For example:\n13 % 2 === 1 // 13 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1\n100 % 10 === 0 // 100 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 0\n\nExercise\nNow improve your code so that it prints out if the number is positive or negative, as well as even or odd.

A \"for loop\" lets you do that in JavaScript. \"For loops\" let you perform the same operation a certain number of times, each time with a different value.\nA for loop has the following syntax:\nfor (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nStatement 1 defines a variable for the loop and assigns it a starting value. It is usually a number, which will increase each time the loop completes an iteration. We can use this number inside the loop to keep track of where we're at. You can set the number to be whatever you want initially.\nvar i = 0;\n\nStatement 2 defines how long the loop will go on for (what needs to happen for the loop to stop running?). It most often uses the less than () or less than or equal to () operators to set the length.\ni \nStatement 3 defines by how much to increment the i variable each time the loop completes an iteration. If you just want it to increase by one, then put i++, or else you can increase by other numbers like so:\ni += 2\n\nInside the square brackets goes the code you wish to be executed each time the loop runs. You can refer to the variable i from inside the loop.\nTry it out\nHere's an example of an actual for loop that prints out the numbers 1 to 10:\nfor (var i = 1; i \nNotice the variable i is set to 1, because we want counting to begin there.

Arrays are to the rescue!\nImagine an array like a list or a collection of variables, but instead of each variable having its own name, only the array has a name. So how do you access a variable inside, then? How do you read and write? Using an index!\nAn index is just a whole number, such as 0, 1, 2 and so forth. As in many areas of computing, indices in JavaScript arrays start with 0 --- so 0 is the index of the first element of an Array, 1 is the index of the second element, and so forth.\nThe syntax is to list the values separated by commas, inside square brackets:\n[value1, value2, value3]\n\nYou can store any type of value inside an array: strings, numbers, booleans. You can even store other arrays, or objects (which you will learn about next).\nTry it out\nDefining an array as a variable looks something like this:\nvar animals = [\"tiger\", \"puppy\", \"snake\", \"llama\"];\n\nPretty neat! Now you have all the animals grouped together rather than having to define them separately. You can see how many animals there are by using .length:\nconsole.log(animals.length);\n\nIf you want to refer to one specific member of the array, you can do so by using their \"index number\" like so.\nconsole.log(animals[1]);\n\n\nTake a guess at which animal that will print out, and see if you're right.\n\nSpoiler alert, it will print out \"puppy\". That might seem weird, until you learn that JavaScript is a \"0-index\" language. What that means is that counting in JavaScript starts at 0. So animals[0]will print out \"tiger\". We don't make the rules...\n\nExercise:\n\nCreate an array that contains the countries of all the students in the class (at least five nationalities)\nconsole.log the number of countries in the Array\nNow, console.log() each country in the list.

A simple arr1 + arr2 will not do, but there is a method you can use: concat(). It is a method that you call on the array (similar to how console.log is the log function called on console) and takes the array you want to append as a parameter.\nvar countries = ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria'];\nvar moreCountries = ['Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France'];\n\ncountries.concat(moreCountries);\n\nAppending an element\nIf you want to append an element to an array, you can just put it after the last existing element like so:\ncountries[countries.length] = 'United States of America';\n\nThere is another way though, which is a bit more elegant: the push function.\ncountries.push('United States of America');\n\n// .push can also be called with multiple parameters\ncountries.push('United States of America', 'France');\n\n\nExercise: Google .slice, .splice, .push and .pop.\n\nUse .push to add another country to your country array.\nUse .pop to remove the last two countries.\nUsing .push, add enough countries to your array so that countries.length is 10. Now use .slice to return the first 3 countries from the array.\nUse .splice to remove the two countries at index positions 5 and 6.\nUse .splice to add a new country at index position 2.\n\nExercise (advanced)\n\nGoogle the .map and .filter methods.\nCreate an array of numbers.

Object literals (literal notation) look like this:\n{\n  property1: \"value1\",\n  property2: \"value2\",\n  property3: \"value3\"\n}\n\nThe names on the left (\"property1\") are known \"keys\". Any values can be given to them: strings, booleans, integers.\nTry it out\nLet's define an object that represents a person:\nvar person = {\n  firstName: \"Nelson\",\n  lastName: \"Mandela\",\n  occupation: \"freedom fighter\",\n  age: 95,\n  alive: false\n};\n\nWe can console.log() the entire object, but you can also reference just one of the properties.

Print out the following:\n\"Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName}. I am {age} years old, and work as a {occupation}.\"\nHint: you can construct longer strings by adding them together. This includes variables. For example:\nvar name = \"Jane\";\nconsole.log(\"People call me \" + name);\n\n// the previous line will print\n// \"People call me Jane\"\n\n\nObject Constructors\nWe can also use the object constructor syntax to make a new object.

But what if we swap the positions of var a and the console.log()?\n  var firstFunction = function() {\n    console.log(a);\n\n    var secondFunction = function() {\n      var a = 10;\n    }\n\n    secondFunction();\n  };\n\n  firstFunction();\n\nThis returns an error: ReferenceError: a is not defined. You might think that the problem is that we're trying to console log a before it's declared in the code order. So let's try putting the console.log(a) after secondFunction, where a is assigned:\n  var firstFunction = function() {\n\n    var secondFunction = function() {\n      var a = 10;\n    }\n\n    console.log(a);\n\n    secondFunction();\n  };\n\n  firstFunction();\n\nWait, we're still getting the ReferenceError! Even if we move the console.log(a) underneath where secondFunction is called, we still get the error. What's going on?\nWhat we're seeing here is the effect of scope. Take a look at the following diagram:\n\nWe can see from this picture that each function is like a 'bubble', and it has access to the variable assigned within it, and the variables assigned 'above' it, in it's surrounding function. But note that the 'global' scope doesn't have access to var o, and function outer() doesn't have access to var i. So each function can access the variables in its parent scope, and in it's own, immediate scope, but it cannot see the variables in its child scope.\nIf a variable is declared outside of a function, in the 'window', it has 'global' scope. The scope within a function is 'local' scope:\n  var test = \"I'm global\";\n\n  function testScope() {\n    var test = \"I'm local\";\n\n    console.log (test);     \n  }\n\n  testScope();           // output: I'm local\n\n  console.log(test);     // output: I'm global\n\n"},"js-core/closures.html":{"url":"js-core/closures.html","title":"Closures","keywords":"","body":"Closures\nA closure is an inner function that retains access to its parent function's scope.\nIt can be used to emulate private properties\nfunction car(){\n  var speed = 0;\n\n  return {\n    faster: function(){\n      var topSpeed = 12;\n      speed += 5;\n\n      if(speed > topSpeed) speed = topSpeed;\n    },\n    getSpeed: function(){\n      return speed;\n    }\n  };\n}\nvar golfCart = car();\ngolfCart.faster();\ngolfCart.faster();\ngolfCart.faster();\nconsole.log(golfCart.getSpeed());\n\nBoth faster and getSpeed functions retain access to the parent scope and thus the variable speed. While the function car returns both of those functions, it does not expose the variable speed directly. We can only access it using those functions essentially making it a private. It is a useful pattern to restrict access to certain variables and ensure that they can only manipulated via set functions. We can use these functions for example to ensure that only valid values are set.\nClosures can also be used to create factories which can retain configuration and be invoked later.\nfunction carFactory(make){\n  return function(){\n    return {\n      make: make\n    };\n  };\n}\n\nvar fordFactory = carFactory('Ford');\nvar car = fordFactory();\nconsole.log(car);\n\nPlease note how fordFactory does not receive any params. Instead it retains access to its parent scope and is able to refer to the parameters the parent was called with. Most importantly it retains access to the parent scope event after the parent function has returned.\n\nExercise:\nCreate an outer function that accepts one parameter greeting (such as 'Hello', 'Hi' or anything else you like)\nand returns a closure which accepts one parameter name and retuns the greeting including name.

Also, if you're only passing one argument into the arrow function, you don't need to use brackets around the parameter:\n  multiplyByTen = num => { return 10 * num };\n\n  console.log(multiplyByTen(5));\n\nIf you're only going to return a single line in an arrow function, you don't even need the curly brackets (or the return keyword):\n  greet = name => `Hello, I am ${name}!`;\n\n  console.log(greet('Ada Lovelace'));\n\nHowever, there are some important differences between arrow functions and ES5 functions aside from syntax. Try the following exercise:\n  const ourClass = {\n    members: ['Raymond', 'Adis', 'Flavia', 'Nabil', 'Kiya'],\n    className: 'London Class 2',\n    classSummary: function() {\n      return this.members.map(function(member) {\n        return `${member} is in ${this.className}`;\n      });\n    }\n  };\n\n  console.log(ourClass.classSummary());\n\nThe above code doesn't quite work. We've got an object, the ourClass object, and within it, and array, a string and a method. But this.className is returning as undefined - the code isn't seeing what we're trying to point it to.\nLet's try with an arrow function:\n  const ourClass = {\n    members: ['Raymond', 'Adis', 'Flavia', 'Nabil', 'Kia'],\n    className: 'London Class 2',\n    classSummary: function() {\n      return this.members.map((member) => {\n        return `${member} is in ${this.className}`;\n      });\n    }\n  };\n\n  console.log(ourClass.classSummary());\n\nWith that one little change, the function is now working. Why? Well, arrow functions differ to ES5 functions in that they make use of something called 'lexical this'. JavaScript is a 'lexical' programming language; this means that how the code behaves depends on the order or placement of each piece of code. When we use an arrow function, the value of this is bound to the surrounding context. So unlike when we used the anonymous function in the ES5 version(this.members.map(function(member) {), the arrow function lets the JavaScript engine know where this is pointing to.\nIf this is confusing, don't worry; we're going to move onto this in greater depth shortly. But first, let's do a few exercises with arrow functions.\n\nExercise:\nUse JSBin for today's exercises.\n\nWrite an arrow function that returns the string, Hello, I am ${name}, and I am ${age} years old.\nWrite an arrow function that takes an array of integers, and returns the sum of the elements in the array. Google and use the built-in reduce array method for this.\nThe syntax of this function is wonky. Can you fix it to use the shortest arrow function possible?\nlet eye = \"eye\";\n\nconst fire =\n(\n\n) =\n>\n{\n return `bulls-`;\n}\n\n\nRefactor the following ES5 function to use an arrow function:const fibonacci = function(n) {\nif (n \n\n\n\n"},"js-core/context.html":{"url":"js-core/context.html","title":"Context","keywords":"","body":"Context\nWhen a function is invoked, it receives the parameters that were passed in as well two other objects\n\narguments - an array-like object which lists all the parameters which were pass into function\nthis - is an object that refers to the current execution context\n\nWhat the actual object this refers to will depend on how the function was called.\nconstructor\nA function called using new operator is called a constructor. It creates a new object inheriting from\nits prototype and sets the value of this to the new object.\n  var Car = function(color){\n    this.color = color;\n  }\n\n  var myCar = new Car('red');\n  console.log(myCar.color) // red\n\nmethod\nA function which is a property of an object is called a method. When a function is invoked as a method this will refer to the parent object.\n  var library = {\n    numberOfBooks: 0,\n    addBooks: function(books){\n      this.numberOfBooks += books;\n    }\n  }\n\n  library.addBooks(7);\n  console.log(library.numberOfBooks) //7\n\nfunction\nA function which does not belong to a method will have its context set to the global object, which is window in the browser and global in Node.\nThat causes several issues.\n\nInner functions cannot see the context of parent methods\nvar library = {\n numberOfBooks: 0,\n addBooks: function(books){\n   this.numberOfBooks += books;\n\n   function double(){\n     this.numberOfBooks *= 2;\n   }\n\n   double();\n }\n}\n\nlibrary.addBooks(5)// 5\nconsole.log(library.numberOfBooks);\n\n\n\nThis is because double is a function and it gets passed the global object as the value of this.\n\nWhen a method is called a function we lose our original scope because this becomes window rather than the parent object.\nvar library = {\n numberOfBooks: 0,\n addBooks: function(books){\n   this.numberOfBooks += books;\n }\n}\n\nvar detached = library.addBooks;\ndetached(7);\nconsole.log(library.numberOfBooks) // 0\n\n\n\nAlso, your global object has now acquired a numberOfBooks property which is not ideal :(\nWe can resolve this in two ways.\n\nUse a temporary variable to capture this which will remain visible to the inner function\nvar library = {\n numberOfBooks: 0,\n addBooks: function(books){\n   var that = this;\n   this.numberOfBooks += books;\n\n   function double(){\n     that.numberOfBooks += books;\n   }\n\n   double();\n }\n}\n\nlibrary.addBooks(5) // 10\nconsole.log(library.numberOfBooks);\n\n\nbind the value of this so it is retained. bind is a method of function which returns a function that has this set to the value passed in as a param.\nvar library = {\n numberOfBooks: 0,\n addBooks: function(books){\n   this.numberOfBooks += books;\n }\n}\n\nvar detached = library.addBooks;\ndetached = detached.bind(library);\ndetached(7);\nconsole.log(library.numberOfBooks) // 7\n\n\n\napply / call\nAnother way to invoke functions is using apply or call methods. They both accept the context, the value that will become this as their first param. The difference is that apply takes the params that will be passed into the method as an array, whereas call takes them as individual params.\n  var book = {\n    author: 'JK Rowling'\n  }\n\n  function addTitle(title){\n    this.title = title;\n  }\n\n  addTitle.call(book, 'Harry Potter');\n  console.log(book.title) // Harry Potter\n\n\nExercise\nAbove we solved the issue 1. with internal method double using tempory variable that and we solved issue 2. with detached context using bind. Please solve issue 1. using bind instead and issue 2. using temporary variable that.\nBelow we turn the push method of the array films into a standalone function and remove the push method from films. However, we still have both the array films and push, they are just separate entities now. Inside addMissionImpossible Calling push('Mission Impossible') throws an error because it no longer has a reference to its context. Also, calling films.push('Mission Impossible') beacuse films no longer has the method push. Use call or apply to invoke to function push with the context films to insert another film title into the array films.\nfunction addMissionImpossible(films, push){\n  // push('Mission Impossible'); // throws error\n  // Array.prototype.push called on null or undefined\n\n  // films.push('Mission Impossible'); // throws error\n  // films.push is not a function\n}\n\nvar films = ['Batman', 'Wonder Woman'];\n\nvar push = films.push;\nfilms.push = null;\n\naddMissionImpossible(films, push);\n\nconsole.log(films);\n\n\n"},"js-core-2/":{"url":"js-core-2/","title":"JavaScript Core II","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core 2\n Example structure:\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\n\n\n\n\n1\nDebugging  Callbacks  Testing  Modules\n\n\n2\nTesting  Modules  Good Design  Object Oriented Programming\n\n\n3\nEvent Listeners  DOM\n\n\n\n"},"js-core-2/debugging.html":{"url":"js-core-2/debugging.html","title":"Debugging","keywords":"","body":"Debugging\nStart by cloning the repo at https://github.com/codeyourfuture/debugging-js-exercises.

That means they can be used in a first class manner like any other object since they are objects themselves. We have seen how to assign a function to a variable and return a function from a function. Now we will look at passing functions into other functions and executing them. This is common technique in JavaScript for dealing with asynchronous behaviour. We have in fact already encountered callbacks when we looked at array methods such as .forEach(), .map() or .filter\nconst evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];\nevenNumbers.forEach(function( num ) {\n    console.log(num);\n});\n\nHere we are passing the function( num ) {console.log(num);} function as an argument to .forEach() to execute with each item in the array evenNumbers.\nfunction x(y){\n    return y + 1;\n}\n\nfunction z(a, callback){\n    return callback(a);\n}\n\nconst out = z(57, x);\nconsole.log(out);\n\nThe above example is synchronous which means that code the callback is executed immediately. Let's look at an example where the code is executed asynchronously. We will use a setTimeout function to delay execution here. In most JavaScript applications asynchronous code execution could be in response to an event such as mouse click or data coming back from a server. We will at both of those cases in detail at a future class.\nfunction delay(callback){\n    setTimeout( callback, 2000 );\n}\n\nfunction logRandom(){\n    const value = Math.round( Math.random() * 10);\n    console.log( value );\n    return value;\n}\n\ndelay(logRandom);\n\nKey points\n\nFunctions can be passed as arguments to other other function\nFunctions that are passed as arguments are called callbacks\nCallbacks may be executed immediately or later\nIf callback is executed later, its return value is lost\n\n\nExercise\nCreate a function called double which will accept one number as its input parameter, multiply it by 2 and return the result. Pass the double function as an argument to the .map() method of numbers below to multiply apply function to each item in the number array.\nconst numbers = [ 6, 8, 18, 10 ];\n\nfunction double /* create rest of the function */\n\nconst output = numbers.map(/* pass the double function here*/);\n\nconsole.log( output );\n\n\nPure functions\nA function is considered a pure function if it does not depend on or modify state outside of its scope. In other words, it will always output the same result given same inputs and will not produce any side effects.\n// Pure function\nfunction( a, b ){\n    return a + b;\n}\n\n// Not a pure function since output value will vary with each call\nfunction( a, b ){\n    return b * Math.random() + a ;\n}\n\n// Not a pure function because it has changed the value outside its scope\nfunction double( in ){\n    in.value *= 2;\n}\n\nconst myObject = {value: 10};\n\ndouble(myObject);\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThe result of pure functions can be cached. This is especially important if we have calculations that may take up a lot of time and resources to compute.\nPure functions are easy to test.

Once the repo is cloned run npm install from inside it to install the dependency libraries.\nUnit testing is a substantial topic. There are many books written about it and many in-depth discussions online. Here we try to focus on the some of the core aspects, but please note that there will be more content than we may not cover here.\nWhat are some of the aspects of unit tests\n\nUnit tests should ensure the correct behaviour or a small unit of code. In JavaScript that usually refers to a single function.\nUnit tests should be automated.\nUnit tests should be fast to run. That enables them to be run by developers in the background or before each commit and pick up any errors as early as possible. This can hugely speed up software development by correcting issues as soon as they are detected rather than wait til a tester or even worse, a customer, finds them.\nUnit tests should mock any external dependencies such as database calls or network access. This is because those operations can be slow, require a lot of effort to be put into the right state or produce non-deterministic results. For example, your code may be correct but if your test requires internet access and the network is down the test will fail, thus creating a false error.\nUnit tests should be easy to maintain. Because they cover only small parts of the code, they should not be affected by code changes outside of the segment being test.\n\nIt brings a number of benefits to your code\n\nHaving unit tests allows us to make changes to our application with a high degree of confidence. The unit tests should tell us if we broke anything.\nUnit tests make it easy for us to notice when we have broken something in our code. Because each unit test covers a small piece of code, it makes it easy to spot where we broke the code.\nWriting testable code forces us to write small functions, with a clear purpose. That also makes our code easy to understand both by ourselves in future as well as other developers. It results in simpler, cleaner design.\n\nAnother approach to testing is end-to-end. Here you would want to test a whole feature of user journey from start to finish. Starting with a click, it may involve an API call over the internet and make changes in database. While they do provide a value and knowledge that your code is running correct, they also have some drawbacks.\n\nEnd-to-end tests can be slow. It can difficult to keep all layers of the test in sync and as a result the tests may end up being run in series rather than parallel.\nThey can break easily because they cover a large number of steps and may be affected by any changes even if those changes are valid.\nThey can be costly to maintain because any changes in application code may require changes in all tests.\nPutting dependencies such as the database into a known state for each test can be tricky.\n\nJest\nWe will be writing our unit tests using a framework called Jest. It's created by Facebook and useful for all kinds of unit testing (especially testing React, which we will do in a later lesson).\nHow do we write unit tests\nLet's look at the anatomy of a unit test.\nfunction sum(a, b){\n    return a + b;\n}\n\ntest('adds', () => {\n  const result = sum(1, 2);\n\n  expect( result ).toBe( 3 );\n});\n\nEach unit test will have the following parts.\nCode to be tested\nThis will usually be a function. Even if we are testing a large object we will usually do so one function at a time.\ntest\nThis is a function which will carry out our test. It expects 2 parameters.\n\nA string describing what we are testing\nA callback that will contain the actual test codematcher\nThis is the part that compares the output of the function being tested with expected outcome. This is a series of chained function calls starting the function expect which takes the result of the execution as its parameter and returns an expectation object with lots of methods that we can use to validate our result.\n\nThe details of all of them are available at [https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html]\n\nOur old friend closure revisited\nfunction expect( result ){\n    return {\n        toBe: function( expected ){\n            validate( result === expected );\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n.toBe() performs a === comparison. Works great for primitives such as strings, numbers and booleans. Fails when comparing objects and arrays because === will check if they refer to the same memory location, not their actual values\nconst a = {b: 'c'};\nexpect(a).toBe({b: 'c'}); // false\n\nTo compare actual values of an object we need a function that will iterate over all of the values making sure they all match.\nconst a = {b: 'c'};\nexpect(a).toEqual({b: 'c'}); // true\n\nWe can also check the opposite of a match by inserting a .not property into our call chain to invert the result of a matcher.\nconst x = {y: 1};\nx.y++;\nexpect(x).not.toBe({y: 1}); // true\n\nThere are dozens of matching functions available. Please refer to the Jest documents for details.\nSingle test execution\nYou will often have fairly large test suites and you may want to isolate one specific test. You can do so by appending the .only() method to the test object. Hence your test will look something like\ntest.only('this will be the only test that runs', () => {\n  expect(true).toBe(false);\n});\n\n"},"js-core-2/modules.html":{"url":"js-core-2/modules.html","title":"Modules","keywords":"","body":"Modules\n\nThis is a bit of an advanced topic at this point. Don't worry if you don't understand all of it - we are going to pick up modules again in a later lesson!\n\nSo far, all our programs have been in their own single files. But Node programs can become really large, and having all our code in only one file will not be maintainable.\nWe can therefore split our code into so-called modules. A module is basically a JavaScript file that makes its functionality available to other modules and programs.\nCreating modules, exporting code\nIt is really simple to take existing JavaScript code and turn it into a module by exporting its functionality:\nfunction printName(name) {\n  console.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = printName;\n\nThe key here is the line containing module.exports. As you see, this is an assignment, and whatever is assigned to module.exports will be made available to other modules and program when this file is imported.\n\nTogether: Let's do this: Edit the file test/sum.test.js and export the function defined there into src/sum.js\n\nUsing modules, importing code\nBut how do we make use of another module in our program? We need to import it, and this is done using a function called require().\n\nThere are different module formats for JavaScript. The one we are using here, which is natively supported by Node, is called CommonJS.\n\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\n\nThe string passed to the require() function is a path to the file you are importing. ./ signifies the current directory, so the above command will import a file called \"printName.js\" that is in the same directory as our program.\n\nAssuming our program is in the same folder as printName.js, we can use the above code to import the functionality provided by that module and store it in the printName variable.\nWe can then continue to use the printName function as if it we defined it in our own program!\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\nprintName();\n\n\nModules can not only export functions, but all variable types you already learned about. Most commonly, they export a function or an object containing multiple functions.\nTogether: Import src/sum.js into test/sum.test.js and run the test\n\nSeparating code and tests\nExporting and importing modules is really useful for testing, too.\nAs a rule of thumb, we never want to mix our actual code with our tests. It is therefore common to put them in separate files. We are going to call the file containing the tests after the file containing the code to be tested, just appending .test at the end of the filename. Like so:\nsum.js                # Our main program\nsum.test.js           # Tests for our main program\nsomeOtherCode.js      # A module called \"someOtherCode\"\nsomeOtherCode.test.js # Tests for the \"someOtherCode\" module\n\nThe naming is really up to convention - you can even put your tests in a different folder! However, for Jest it is important to call test files \"*.test.js\".\nExercise: Edit test/sum.test.js. Move the actual sum function to a different file (src/sum.js) and export it from there. The go back to your test file and import the sum function from sum.js.\nExercise: Run npm test function inside unit-testing-london. We have 10 failing tests.\n\nTo begin with export the functions object from src/functions.js and import it into test/functions.test.js.\nImplement all the functions in src/functions.js so all the unit test pass when you run npm test function. Do not make remove or change any tests in test/functions.test.js.\nCreate a function src/functions.js that accepts 2 arrays as arguments and returns a new array which contains all the items from the two inputs. Write a test for that function in test/functions.test.js.\n\n\n"},"js-core-2/good-design.html":{"url":"js-core-2/good-design.html","title":"Good Design","keywords":"","body":"``js\nfunction printHelloFiveTimes(){\n  for ( var i = 0; i \n\n> Exercise: Now, let's look at a different example.

But what makes good design? Is it just \"shorter is always better\"?\nGood Design\nDesign is important if we want our code to be understandable (both to other humans, but also to us in the future), to be easy to use and easy to expand.\nThere are three main principles you need to know now: clarity, reusability and extensibility. There are also others, but they are deeply related to these three.\nTo\n\nEase of Maintenance / Clarity\n\nNaming\nFormatting\nCommenting\nClear logic\nConcise\nAvoiding Redundancy\n\n\nReusability\n\nDRY\nSingle Reponsibility\nAvoiding global state (scope)\nPredictability and Ease of testing\n\n\n\n\nExtensibility\n\nAvoiding being unnecessarily specific (e.g. magic numbers)\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Find all the design issues with this function.\n\nAs an aside: if you try to run the code it won't work, but not because it's not correct. It's only because it is a fragment of a larger program and lacks some code such as the function updateCorpDatabase(), the initialisation of the global variables referenced (e.g. quarter, profit) and, of course, the HandlesStuff() function also hasn't been called.\n``js\nfunction HandlesStuff(inputRecord, savedrecord, income1, income2, expenseType, revenue, expense0, expense1, expense2, screenx, screeny, success){\n  var i;\n  for ( i = 0; i \nupdateCorpDatabase( savedrecord );\nincome1 = income2 * 4.0 / quarter;\n\nif( expenseType == 0 ) {\n  profit = revenue - expense0;\n}\nelse if( expenseType == 1 ) {\n  profit = revenue - expense1;\n}\n\nelse if( expenseType == 2 ){\n  profit = revenue - expense2;\n}\n}\n\nWhat is wrong with this function?\n\n1. Naming: the function has a bad name, HandleStuff() tells you nothing about what the function does. It's also considered bad practice to name variables vaguely by separating them through numbers (debt1, expense1, etc). If you find yourself doing this then you should either use an array (such as expenses[]) or use a more specific name for each variable (such as pastIncome and currentIncome). There is also inconsistency in the use of camel casing (inputRecord versus savedrecord).\n\n2. Commenting: the function isn't documented at all. It's very difficult to understand what the function's purpose is and how each part of the code contributes to it. By writing comments, the coder communicates their reasoning and helps the function be human readable.\n\n3. Layout/ Formatting: the physical organisation of the code on the page gives few hints about its logical organisation. Layout strategies are used inconsistently throughout the code: incorrect indentation, unnecessary spacing (between the two else ifs) and the long list of parameters is unreadable. This makes the code look messy and confusing.\n\n4. Input variables: the function's input variable, inputRecord, is set (hardcoded) within the function. If it's an input variable, its value should not be modified. If the value of the variable is supposed to be modified, then the variable should not be called inputRecord.\n\n5. Global variables: the function reads and writes global variables - it reads from quarter and writes to profit. It should communicate with other functions more directly, rather than by reading and writing global variables.\n\n6. Single Responsibility: the function does not have a single purpose. It initialises some variables, writes to a database, does some calculations - none of which seem to be related to each other in any way. A function should have a single, clearly defined purpose. This function looks like it needs restructuring: breaking it into multiple functions.\n\n7. Data checks: the function doesn't defend itself against bad data. If quarter equals 0, the expression income2 * 4.0 / quarter causes a divide-by-zero error.\n\n8. Magic numbers: the function uses several magic numbers: 100, 4.0, 1, 2 and 3. These are numbers that are used directly in an expression rather than saving them first in a variable. This is discouraged as it makes it more difficult to manipulate the values. If we were to save them in a variable they would be easier to find and modify.\n\n``js\ntenSquared =  10*10\ntenCubed = 10*10*10\n\nx = 10\nxSquared =  x*x\nxCubed = x*x*x\n\nUseless parameters: some of the function's parameters are never used (screenx, screeny and success). They should be removed because they are confusing. It is tempting when you're starting to code a function to add more parameters thinking that you might need them, but it's important to remove them if you don't end up using them.\n\nDRY principle: the function breaks the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule. The expression profit = revenue - expense0 is written 3 times unnecessarily, the only difference being whether it's the first, second or third expense. This variable can be restructured into an array.\n\n\n``js\nvar expense = [expense1,expense2,expense3];\nprofit = revenue - expense[expenseType];\n```\n\nExercise: We have the following problem to solve, write really bad code that gives the right result.

At the highest level is code that can be easily understood by a person. At the very lowest level is binary code and electric signals (e.g. 00101010110) that can be understood by computer hardware. There are many levels of abstraction in between, so programmers don't have to interact with details of the system that are not revelant to them (such as how the programming language works, or how memory gets allocated).\nSo far, in the solutions we wrote, we think in terms of steps: DoStep1, DoStep2, DoStep3 until we solve a problem. We're thinking in the Verbs that constitute a solution. Our abstractions are functions that do things to reach a solution. We can use a function without knowing how it works (think about console.log()) - the abstraction of that function hides the complexity of how console.log actually works.\nNow we will step into a new way of writing of abstractions - Object Oriented Programming (OOP).\n\nThe basic idea of OOP is that we use objects to model things that we want to represent inside our programs, and/or provide a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.\n\nOO overview\nDefining an object template (classes)\n\nIn OOP we create templates for objects that we will create. These are often called classes.\nCreating actual objects (instances)\n\nFrom a class we can create (or instantiate) an object. This process is called instantiation.\nSpecialist classes\n\n\nExercise: On a paper, let's model  our class - what classes do we have, what objects, what properties do they have, can we create any specialised classes?\n\nObject literals\nThere are several ways to create objects - we've already used one before: object literals.\nvar person = {}\nIn the example above an empty object is created. Let's create a more sophisticated object.\n``js\nvar person = {\n  name: ['Simon', 'Muong'],\n  age: 32,\n  gender: 'male',\n  interests: ['javascript', 'html'],\n  greeting: function() {\n    alert('Hi! I\\'m ' + this.name[0] + '.');\n  }\n};\n\nSo what is going on here? Well, an object is made up of multiple _properties_, each of which have a _name_ (e.g. `name` and `age` above), and a _value_ (e.g. `['Bob', 'Smith']` and `32`). Each name/value pair must be separated by a comma, and the name and value in each case are separated by a colon. The syntax always follows this pattern.\n\nThe value of an object property can be pretty much anything — in our person object we've got a string, a number, two arrays, and two functions. The first four items are _data items_, and are referred to as the object's properties. The last two items are functions that allow the object to do something with that data, and are referred to as the object's `methods`.\n\n> Methods are functions that allow the object to do something with its data.\n\n> The `this` keyword refers to the context when the method is called. In this case, when calling `person.greeting()` the context is `person`, so `this` refers to that person object. `this` is a much more complicated and confusing topic in JavaScript but we will come back to it again and again.\n\nAn object like the one in our example is referred to as an object literal — we've **literally** written out the object contents as we've come to create it. This is in contrast to objects instantiated from classes, which we'll look at next.\n\n> Exercise: write this Person object that we just implemented. Add a `method` called `printBio` that prints the interests of that person.\n\n> Exercise: create another object for a different person with the same `methods` but different data (different name, interests etc...)\n\n## Constructor functions\n\n> Exercise: Let's create a function called `createPerson` that takes a `name` as a parameter and returns an object.\n\nSome programming languages have a `class` keyword that allows programmers to create that template of an Object.\nJavaScript, instead, uses special functions called constructor functions to define objects and their features. They are useful because you'll often come across situations in which you don't know how many objects you will be creating; constructors provide the means to create as many objects as you need in an effective way, attaching data and functions to them as required.\n\nLet's look at how `constructor functions` work.\n\n\n``js\nfunction Person(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.greeting = function() {\n    alert('Hi! I am ' + this.name + '.');\n  };\n}\nThis is the template that defines what a Person should look like. Now let's create a specific object, an instance of Person.\n``js\nvar sally = new Person('Sally');\nconsole.log(sally); // { name: 'Sally': greeting:  }\nconsole.log(sally instanceof Person); // true\n```\nYou'll see that the this keyword is being used again here. What exactly is this? When a constructor function is called with the new operator, a new object is created (called an instance), and the this keyword is a reference to that object. In our example we add a property (name) and a method (greeting) to this. Now, whenever Person is instantiated, it returns an object with a name property and a greeting method.\nYou'll also notice that the constructor function take a parameter, name (which gets passed to Person in the example above). When Person is instantiated the name parameter is assigned to this.name (as well as being used to configure the greeting method).\n\nSome people argue that JavaScript is not a true object-oriented language — for example, it doesn't have a class statement for creating classes, unlike many OO languages. JavaScript, instead, uses special functions called constructor functions to define objects and their features. They are useful because you'll often come across situations in which you don't know how many objects you will be creating; constructors provide the means to create as many objects as you need in an effective way, attaching data and functions to them as required.\nExercise: Let's add another property to that Person called gender that will take either 'male' or 'female' as values (these will be passed as parameters same as name).\nExercise: add a method called displayInfo that will print the person's name with 'Mr' or 'Ms' depending on the gender of the Person.\n\n"},"js-core-2/dom.html":{"url":"js-core-2/dom.html","title":"The DOM","keywords":"","body":"The DOM\nYour webpages are made up of a bunch of HTML elements, nested within each other (parents and children). In JavaScript we have access to this \"DOM\" object (Document Object Model) which is actually a representation of our webpage that JavaScript can work with.\nHere are two examples, HTML and then JavaScript, of how the DOM might look like:\n\n    \n         Welcome! \n         Hello world! \n    \n\n\nvar document = {\n    body: {\n        h1: \"Welcome\",\n        p: \"Hello world!\"\n    }\n};\n\nIn the browser the DOM is represented by the window.document object, which can also be accessed directly using document. We can use it to get information about the page loaded into the browser, query the content of the page and edit it. You can see full details of the functionality at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document .\nQuerying\nThe DOM offers a lot of useful functions we can use to find elements on the page. Here are some we'll be using today:\nelement = document.getElementById(id);\n\ngetElementById accepts an id string as argument and returns an Element from the document with a matching id. If no matching Element is found the function returns null.\nelements = document.getElementsByClassName(names); // or:\nelements = rootElement.getElementsByClassName(names);\n\ngetElementsByClassName takes a string containing one or more classes and returns an HTMLCollection, which is an array-like object containing all elements whose class attributes match the string. We can pass multiple classes as an argument to query for elements matching all classes.\ngetElementsByClassName('green bike')\n\nAbove call will return elements that have both the green and bike classes.\ngetElementsByClassName can be called on individual elements as well as the top-level document object. When calling getElementsByClassName on an element, the method will query only the children of the element rather than the entire document\nelements = document.getElementsByTagName(name); // or:\nelements = rootElement.getElementsByTagName(name);\n\nMuch like getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName allows us to query for elements using the tag name. getElementsByTagName also returns HTMLCollection and can be called on elements as well as document.\nAll of the above calls return a live reference, which means that the objects will be automatically updated with all changes since the query.\n\nExercise:\n\nClone the repo from HTML and CSS class into new bikes directory.  git clone git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/bikes-for-refugees.git bikes\nCreate an index.js file in src folder inside the bikes repo.\nPut the following code in the index.js file: alert('hello'); to check the file is being loaded\nImport the index.js file into index.html by placing  just before the closing body html tag.\nOpen index.html in your browser.\nIn index.js:\nUsing getElementById, getElementsByClassName or getElementsByTagName ...\n... get the element with id donation-count-alert and console.log it. Look up documentation for Element or use a debugger find and console.log the contents of the element.\n... get all elements with the class btn, loop over them and console.log them individually. You may need to look up documentation for HTMLCollection.\n... get all links inside the element with id navbarSupportedContent, loop over the collection and console.log the text inside each link\n\n\nQuery selector\nThe above selector functions are available in all browsers, but can be somewhat inflexible for example in situations that require complex lookups. Modern browsers have\ndocument.querySelector('#mainHeader');\ndocument.querySelectorAll('p');\n\nBoth .querySelector and querySelectorAll accept a CSS selector as an input.\n.querySelector selects only the first element it finds, querySelectorAll selects all elements and returns a NodeList, which is a collection of Nodes (not an array). Unlike the selectors in the previous section, these functions return static results. That means any changes in the DOM will NOT result in updates to the elements.\n\nExercise:\n\nComment out the code from previous exercise and rewrite solutions using querySelector and querySelectorAll. You may need to look up documentation for NodeList.\n\n\nDOM manipulation\nWe can use the DOM to edit elements. For example the textContent property of elements can used to read as well as set the text contents of an element.\nvar x = document.querySelector('.jumbotron h1');\nconsole.log(x.textContent) // Bikes for Refugees\nx.textContent = \"Something else\";\n\nSimilarly, innerHTML property of elements can be used to get the HTML content of an element as well as\nvar x = document.querySelector('.jumbotron h1');\nx.innerHTML = `${x.textContent}`;\n\nWe can also access the style property of elements and update various properties\nvar elements = document.querySelectorAll('.btn-primary');\n\nelements.forEach( element => element.style.backgroundColor = 'red' );\n\nPlease note the use of camelCase style attribute names\nWe can also check it exists, read, change and remove attributes of elements using hasAttribute, getAttribute(), removeAttribute and setAttribute\nvar elements = document.querySelectorAll('a');\n\nelements.forEach( element => {\n  if( element.hasAttribute('href') ){\n    var href = element.getAttribute('href');\n    console.log(href);\n    element.setAttribute('href', 'https://google.com');\n  }\n});\n\nWhat will above code do?\n\nExercise:\n\nUse above functions to\n... place - around the text in the navbar links\n... convert links in 'Upcoming Events' section to italic using  tag\n... make 'Learn more` links green\n\n\nCreating and inserting elements\nWe can use document.createElement(tagName) method to create a new element and document.createTextNode(text) to create new text contents. The elements created can be manipulated just like the elements above, but the changes will not visible until we insert the new element into the DOM.\nWe can insert elements into other elements using element.appendChild or element.insertBefore. For example.\n\n    some content\n\n\nvar spanNode = document.createElement('span');\nvar textNode = document.createTextNode('hello');\nspanNode.appendChild(textNode);\n\nvar parentNode = document.getElementById('parent');\nparentNode.appendChild(spanNode);\n\nWhat do you think above code will do?\ninsertBefore is a bit more complicated.\nvar insertedNode = parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode);\n\nHere insertedNode is the the node being inserted, that is newNode. parentNode is the the parent of the newly inserted node. newNode is the node to be inserted and referenceNode is the node before which newNode is inserted.\nThere is no insertAfter method. It can be emulated by combining the insertBefore method with nextSibling property. In the line below we use this approach to insert nodeOne after nodeTwo inside parentNode\nparentNode.insertBefore(nodeOne, nodeTwo.nextSibling);\n\n\nExercise:\n\nUse the inspector to examine the navbar\nCreate a new navbar item for Code Your Future which links to https://codeyourfuture.co/\nInsert it at the end of the navbar\n\n\nResources\n\nDocument\n\n"},"js-core-2/events.html":{"url":"js-core-2/events.html","title":"Events","keywords":"","body":"Browser events\nBrowser events are actions that take place on our web page. They could be user triggered such as a mouse being clicked, a key being pressed or a form submitted. Alternatively, they could be triggered by the system such as a resource being loaded or an error occurring.\nWe can subscribe to those events using by registering an eventHandler to perform a certain action when an event is detected. For example, we may want to update a letter count on a text input when a user types or we may want to perform validation on a form before submitting it.\nFor each event subscription we will need 3 things.\n\ntarget - this is the object where we are listening for events on. For example, it could be a link on which we would like to listen to for clicks.\neventType - as the name suggests, this is the type of event we ar listening for. There are dozens of possible events (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events for full list). Common ones include\nclick - mouse click\nsubmit - form submit\nkeydown - keyboard key being pressed\nmouseenter - a mouse cursor being moved onto an element\nchange - value of a form input changing\n\n\neventHandler - A function that we want to execute when the event is detected\n\nTo subscribe to the actual event we use the addEventListener method of our target element like below\nvar myButton = document.querySelector('#myButton');\nmyButton.addEventListener(\"click\", alertSomething);\n\nfunction alertSomething() {\n    alert(\"Something\");\n}\n\nIn the above code myButton is the target on which we listen to for click events and call the event handler alertSomething when the click is detected.\n\nExercise:\n\nSet a click listener on the donate buttons and increment the donated bikes counter with each click\n\n\nEvent object\nJust knowing that an event has happened is not particularly useful in most cases. Usually, we will want to know more about what exactly happened such as the coordinates of a mouse click or the new value of an input after it has changed.\nKeep in mind that different event types will have characteristics that are specific to them. For example, key events will have a event.char property indicating the key that was pressed. mouse events will have event.clientX and event.clientY properties indicating the location of the mouse event on the screen, where (0,0) is the top left hand corner in the browser.\nEvery event object has event.preventDefault() which when called will prevent the default action of the event from being triggered. This is particularly useful to intercepting events and altering the behaviour when needed. For example, we can call event.preventDefault() on a submit event if the data in the form is not valid.\nWe can find out which element the event was triggered on from the event.target property.\n\nExercise:\n\nPrevent clicks on links from triggering a url change in the browser and instead console.log the coordinates of the click as well as the text inside the link\n\n\nBubbling\n\nTogether:\n\nLet's place a click listener on the .jumbotron element and console.log the event\nWhat happens when we click on the buttons?\n\n\nMost events, though not all, have a default behaviour know as bubbling which results in events being propagated to the target element's parents. That means an event listener placed on the parent will be triggered after the event listener placed on the child. Why is this behaviour desired?\nWe can distinguish between the elements on which the event was triggered vs the element on which the event was detected.\n\nevent.target is the element on which received the initial event\nevent.currentTarget is the element on which the event listener detected the event\n\nIn some cases we may want to prevent an event from bubbling up. We can do so by calling the stopPropagation method on the event. Once it has been called, any event handlers placed by parent elements will not be triggered.\n\nExercise:\n\nPlace a single event listener on the body of the document\nconsole.log the text inside each linked clicked, but perform no action for clicks originating from inside the jumbotron.\n\n\nResources\n\nIntroduction to browser events\nEvents\n\n"},"js-core-2/ajax.html":{"url":"js-core-2/ajax.html","title":"AJAX","keywords":"","body":"AJAX\nWhat's a server?\nA device or program that provides functionality to other programs or devices. There are database servers, mail servers, game servers, etc.\nThey can take the form of industrial server farms that provide a service to millions of users (used by Facebook, Google, etc.), to personal servers for storing your files.\nThe server communicates with clients. Clients can be a web browser, a Slack app, your phone, etc.\nClient–server systems use the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgement.\n\nAn example: We can use the Slack app (the client) to put our messages or pictures on Slack. The content is stored on the Slack servers and other clients can then also access the pictures.\n\nHTTP requests\nA server stores the data, and the client (other programs or computers) requests data or sends some of its own. But how do they talk to each other?\nFor the client and the server to communicate they need an established language (a protocol). Which is what HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is for. It defines the methods you can use to communicate with a server and indicate your desired actions on the resources of the server.\nThere are two main types of requests: GET and POST.\n\nWith a GET request you can ask for specified resource (e.g. show me that Slack photo).\nWith a POST request you can send content to the server to be appended to the web resource (e.g. post a photo on Slack).\n\nHTTP is the language of the internet. In our case we're using Javascript, but you can send HTTP requests with other laguages as well.\nAJAX (= Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)\nAJAX is a set of useful methods for implementing client-server communication.\n\nAJAX just uses a combination of:\n\n\nA browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)\nJavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)\n\n\nAjax works behind the scenes, helping the webpage communicate with the server (with GET and POST requests).\n\nclient ----------GET request----------> server returns data to client\nclient ----------POST request (with content)--------->server updates data with content\n\nThe server holds the data, but it only sends it to the webpage when there's a request. The request can be sent after the page has loaded, for example when a user clicks a button.\nWhy Ajax?\nThere are other ways you can write HTTP requests, such as using Web sockets. What's great about AJAX is that it makes it look like magic! The server and the client communicate effortlessly:\n\nUpdate a web page without reloading the page\nRequest data from a server - after the page has loaded\nReceive data from a server - after the page has loaded\nSend data to a server - in the background\n\nAJAX Example\nThe instant update: we can write code that makes the web page instantly update its contents (without reloading the page).\nLet's try sending some data from Rares’ phone to the server and see whether it will update the webpage.\n\nhttp://zero-point.github.io/\n\nLet's Code!\nHow does the code work?

For example to create a string you can write\nvar myString = 'Hello';\n\nAnd to create an array:\nvar myArray = ['hello', 1, 2];\n\nAnd an object, just for fun:\nvar myObject = {\n  name: 'Daniel',\n  age: 10,\n  interests: ['JavaScript', 'Cycling']\n};\n\nThis is the best way to create new data, but it's helpful to know that you can also create new data using the new operator and a built in constructor function.\nFor example, you could also create a new string like this:\nvar myString = new String('Hello');\n\nOr an array:\nvar myArray = new Array(1,2,3);\n\n\nDo not actually create data using this approach in practice. These examples are for learning purposes only!\n\nString is a constructor function just like the constructor functions we learnt to write in the previous session, and myString is an instance of String. (Kinda cool how JavaScript is built on JavaScript, huh?!)\nWhen you check what a string looks like created in this way, things get a bit weird though:\nvar myString = new String('Hello');\nconsole.log(myString);\n\nWill log:\nString {\n  0: \"h\",\n  1: \"e\",\n  2: \"l\",\n  3: \"l\",\n  4: \"o\",\n  length: 5,\n  [[PrimitiveValue]]: \"hello\"\n}\n\nWhoa! What happened to my string?! Why does this happen? Why isn't myString just 'hello'?\nThe first reason is that, if you remember back to the previous session, constructor functions create objects. Calling new  always returns an object.\nThe second reason is that any objects a constructor creates can be given methods, and methods for built in data types turn out to be extremely useful.\n\nRecap: methods are functions that belong to an object\n\nWe can try calling some of the methods given to strings.\nmyString.toUpperCase(); // hello\nmyString.split(''); // ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']\nmyString.endsWith('o'); // true\n\nYou might also have noticed that our instance of String also has a length property, so we can go ahead and find out the length of our string:\nmyString.length; // 5\n\nBefore we move onto the next section, just remember that the purpose of this lesson was to improve our understanding of how JavaScript work. You don't need to actually create data using new String() to get access to all the methods provided by String (JavaScript does this for you behind the scenes).\nExercises:\n\nCreate a string using literal syntax and call the .toUpperCase() method on it\nCreate an array and call the .push() method on it\nCreate a string using the built in String constructor function and note any differences from using literal syntax\nCall a method e.g. .toUpperCase() on a string you created using the String constructor function\n\nLearn about split and join\n"},"js-core-3/inheritance.html":{"url":"js-core-3/inheritance.html","title":"Inheritance","keywords":"","body":"Inheritance using Constructor.prototype\nIn the previous lesson we learnt how to write methods like this:\nfunction Person(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.greeting = function greeting() {\n    alert('Hello my name is ' + this.name);\n  }\n}\nUsing this approach, every time that Person is instantiated, a new greeting function is created. If you create a new Person() 100 times, 100 greeting functions will be created for each one. This seems wasteful considering all the greeting functions are exactly the same.\nOne way to solve this is using prototypal inheritance. That sounds a bit scary so let's take it a step at a time.\nWe can say that a property is inherited when it is passed down from a parent. For example, perhaps one of the properties your parents passed to you was being really good looking. You might say that it's a family trait.\nIn JavaScript, there are 2 ways that a new objects receives properties. The first is copying, the way we've being doing it so far: inside the constructor function properties are added to the new object (this) when it is created. The properties are inherited from the (parent) constructor function, but once the object has been created the constructor function cannot change it.\nprototype\nThe other way that objects can receive properties from their constructor function is by inheritance. This happens via the constructor function's prototype, which is an object containing hidden properties and methods.\n\nExercise\nOpen up the console in your web browser and type in String.prototype. An object with will be returned. If you expand this object you'll see that it contains several hidden methods.\nYou can also search on the internet for \"String prototype\", \"Array prototype\" etc. and find documentation for the associated methods.\n\nWhen you create a new object, a hidden link is made between the new object and it's constructor function's prototype.\nWe can test that this link exists in our browser's console:\nfunction MyConstructor () {}\nvar myObj = new MyConstructor();\nObject.getPrototypeOf(myObj) === MyConstructor.prototype; // true\n\nLet's add a method to our constructor function's prototype:\nMyConstructor.prototype.greeting = function () {\n  console.log('Hello');\n}\n\nThe greeting method will now be inherited by objects created with MyConstructor.\nvar myObj2 = new Constructor();\nmyObj2.greeting(); // Hello\n\nRemember that when objects are created a link between them and their constructor is created? Well, even though myObj was created before we added the greeting method, myObj is linked to MyConstructor.prototype, so it will inherit the newly created method as well.\nmyObj.greeting(); // Hello\n\nBoth myObj and myObj2 inherit properties from MyConstructor via prototypal inheritance.\nObject.getPrototypeOf(myObj) === Object.getPrototypeOf(myObj2) === MyConstructor.prototype; // true\n\nThe prototype chain\nWhen you access a property of an object, JavaScript first checks if the object has such a property itself. If it does it will use that. If not, it will check the object's prototype.\nfunction Person (name, formal) {\n  this.name = name;\n  if (formal) {\n    this.greeting = function () {\n      console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPerson.prototype.greeting = function () {\n  console.log('Hey, it\\'s ' + this.name);\n}\n\nvar alice = new Person('Alice');\n// No greeting method on alice\nconsole.log(alice); // { name: 'Alice' }\nalice.greeting(); // Hey it's Alice\n\nvar bob = new Person('Bob', true);\n// bob was instantiated with a greeting method\nconsole.log(alice); // { name: 'Bob', greeting: function() {} }\nbob.greeting(); // Hello, my name is Bob\n\n"},"js-core-3/array-methods.html":{"url":"js-core-3/array-methods.html","title":"Array Methods & Callbacks","keywords":"","body":"Array methods and callbacks\nThe most useful built in methods in JavaScript are the Array.prototype methods. Every array has access to these methods (because Arrays are created by the Array constructor function they inherit the the properties of Array.prototype).\nOf particular use are the Array methods that enable you to iterate over an array. We've covered iteration already when we learnt how to use for loops. Well, I have some amazing news for you - you will probably never need to write a for loop again!\nLet's take a look at Array.prototype.forEach first. This is pretty much a straight replacement for for loops.\nvar myArr = [1,2,3];\n\nmyArr.forEach(function (item) {\n  console.log(item);\n});\n\n// 1\n// 2\n// 3\n\nOOOOF! Wasn't that glorious?! Much nicer than writing a for loop! So how exactly does this work? forEach iterates over each item the array. For each item is calls a function - the one that was provided as an parameter to forEach.\nCallback functions\nFunctions that are provided as parameters to another function are called callback functions. Often we will write these functions inside the function call like did in the forEach example, but we can also pass in reference to an already defined function:\nfunction callback(item) {\n  console.log(item);\n}\n\nmyArr.forEach(callback);\n\nWhether you define your function beforehand or write it straight into the function call will depend on whether you intend on re-using that callback again.\nMore array methods\nPreviously we've used for loops to create new versions of an array doing something like this:\nvar arr = [1,2,3];\nvar newArr = [];\n\nfor (var i = 0; i \nThere are several methods on Array.prototype that can be used for this sort of task.\nThe most popular method is .map(), which does the following:\n\niterates over the array it is called on\ncalls a callback function on every iteration\npasses in the current array item and its index to the callback function\nuses the returned value from the callback function to populate a new array\nreturns the new array\n\nThat sounds like a lot but once you use .map() a few times it'll begin to feel more intuitive. Let's try it and see if we can refactor the for loop example:\nvar arr = [1,2,3];\nvar newArr = arr.map(function (num) {\n  return num + 1\n});\nconsole.log(newArr); // [2,3,4]\n\nAnother useful array method is .filter(). It works in a similar way to map except that rather than return a value in the callback function, you return true or false depending on whether you want the current item to be included in the new array. Returning true means that you want to keep the item, returning false means it should be omitted.\nLet's create a new array with only numbers greater than 5:\nvar arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];\nvar newArr = arr.filter(function (num) {\n  return arr > 5\n});\nconsole.log(newArr); // [5,6,7,8,9]\n\n\nRemember: Most array methods do not change the current array, they return a new array. Check the MDN documentation for the array method if you are not sure about this.\n\nChaining methods\nIf we want to apply more than one array method to an array we might try something like this, creating an intermediate variable after each transformation.\nvar arr = [1,2,3];\nvar arrMapped = arr.map(function (num) {\n  return num + 1;\n});\nvar arrFiltered = newArr.filter(function (num) {\n  return num > 5;\n});\n\nThis can get quite awkward though, especially when you have to think of a variable name for each stage. Thankfully there is a much simpler way. We can chain methods together:\nvar newArr = [1,2,3]\n  .map(function (num) {\n    return num + 1;\n  });\n  .filter(function (num) {\n    return num > 5;\n  });\n\nThere's nothing magical happening here. This works because:\n\nthe array methods are returning new arrays\nevery array has access to all the array methods on Array.prototype\n\nAs soon as an array is returned by an array method we can call another array method on the return value.\n\nExercise\nTransform the following array [4,5,3,6,7,8,9,1,2] by 1) sorting it, 2) doubling each number, and 3) filtering numbers less than 10\nWrite named functions that can be used as callbacks.\n\n"},"js-core-3/es6.html":{"url":"js-core-3/es6.html","title":"ES6","keywords":"","body":"Intro to ES6\nECMAScript 2015 (or ES6) is a significant update to JavaScript that introduces new syntax for writing complex applications including classes and modules and other features.\nconst and let\non JS Bin, let's write this simple code snippet\n``js\nfunction sayGreeting(name, gender) {\n    var greeting = 'Hello';\n    var nameWithTitle;\n    if (gender === 'female') {\n        nameWithTitle = 'Ms. ' + name;\n    } else {\n        nameWithTitle = 'Mr. ' + name;\n    }\n    return greeting + name;\n}\n// sayGreeting('Rares', 'male') should return 'Hello Mr. Rares'\n// sayGreeting('Irina', 'female') should return ' Hello Ms. Irina'\n```\n\nExercise: Let's update this code to use let and const instead of var\n\nTemplate literals\n\nExercise: We do a lot of string concatenation in JavaScript - ES6 introduces a more elegant way of accomplishing the same.

That means only the value\nthe variables was holding is passed to the function, and not a reference to the variable's\nlocation in memory. That means that inside a function call, any changes we make to its\narguments will only apply inside the function (as seen in the previous example).\n\n**Be careful though**, as the value of an argument might be a reference to a JavaScript\nobject, in which case, changing a property on that object will also reflect everywhere\nelse we use a reference to that object.\n\nFor example:\n\n``js\n\nfunction a(primitive, object) {\n    primitive = primitive + 5;\n    object.greeting = \"how are you?\";\n    object = {\n      greeting: \"holla!\"\n    };\n}\nvar primitive = 10;\nvar object = {\n  greeting: 'hello'\n};\na(primitive, object);\nconsole.log(primitive); // 10\nconsole.log(object.greeting); // \"how are you?\"\n\nLet's look at the illustrations here: http://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-primitive-vs-reference-values/ to understand this behavior better\nExercise\n\nOpen up the CodePen here\nCreate a new index.html and main.js file\nLink the main.js from the index.html so that it runs in the browser\nCopy the exercises from the CodePen above into main.js and follow the instructions in the comments\n\n\n"},"js-core-3/scope.html":{"url":"js-core-3/scope.html","title":"Scope","keywords":"","body":"Scope\nBefore we get into what scope is, let's try a little exercise.\nOpen up jsbin and write the following:\nfunction () {\n    var name = \"hello\";\n}\nconsole.log(name);\n\n\nWhat do you think the first console.log will print?\n\nvar hello = \"outer\";\nfunction() {\n    var hello = \"inner\";\n    console.log(hello);\n}\n\n\nWhat do you think calling the function will print?\n\nLet's see another example\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n    var a = 10;\n\n    var secondFunction = function() {\n        console.log(a);\n    }\n\n    secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nThis should work fine, and the console should print 10. But what if we swap the positions of var a and the console.log()?\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n    console.log(a);\n\n    var secondFunction = function() {\n        var a = 10;\n    }\n\n    secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nThis returns an error: ReferenceError: a is not defined. You might think that the problem is that we're trying to console log a before it's declared in the code order. So let's try putting the console.log(a) after secondFunction, where a is assigned:\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n\nvar secondFunction = function() {\n    var a = 10;\n}\n\nconsole.log(a);\n\nsecondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nWait, we're still getting the ReferenceError! Even if we move the console.log(a) underneath where secondFunction is called, we still get the error. What's going on?\nWhat we're seeing here is the effect of scope. Take a look at the following diagram:\n\nWe can see from this picture that each function is like a 'bubble', and it has access to the variable assigned within it, and the variables assigned 'above' it, in it's surrounding function. But note that the 'global' scope doesn't have access to var o, and function outer() doesn't have access to var i. So each function can access the variables in its parent scope, and in it's own, immediate scope, but it cannot see the variables in its child scope.\nIf a variable is declared outside of a function, in the 'window', it has 'global' scope. The scope within a function is 'local' scope:\nvar test = \"I'm global\";\n\nfunction testScope() {\n    var test = \"I'm local\";\n    console.log (test);\n}\n\ntestScope();           // output: I'm local\n\nconsole.log(test);     // output: I'm global\n\n"},"node/server.html":{"url":"node/server.html","title":"Server","keywords":"","body":"What is a server?\nServers are computer programs that receive requests from other programs, the clients and send back a response e.g share data, information or hardware and software resources.\n...and what is a server in plain English?\nA server is a computer program.

Type the following command into your terminal to get started:\n$ npm init\nThis command will initialise a step-by-step process for creating the package.json. You should see something like this:\n\nIt will ask you a bunch of questions.\n\nYou can skip most of the questions but change the entry point from (index.js) to server.js.\nThe wizard asks you for the following information: name, version, description, main, test, repository, keywords, author, license - do you understand all of them?\n\nAt the endo of the wizard, you should see a new file called package.json in your project's folder.\nHere is an example package.json file for a project called Passport.\nStep 2 - Installing Express\nBefore we write any code, you'll need to install the Express library. We're going to use the Node Package Manager (npm) to download it using the npm install command.\nNPM is the place to go to download other Node code written by other people.  There are thousands of open-source, 3rd-party Node modules (also known as \"packages\") by other people that you can download and use in your own projects.\nAs we install Express, we'll need to update the package.json to add Express as a dependency. We do this so that other people working on the project will know to install Express before running any of the code. This can be done by adding --save to the end of your command.\nRun the following command in your terminal:\n$ npm install express --save\nExpress should now be installed. Check your package.json file to make sure it has been added as a dependency. It will look like this:\n\nStep 3 - Building the server\nThe first thing we need to do is build our server. You will always need to build a server when writing back-end code. A server can be built in pure Node.js, but Express gives us simpler syntax to work with.\n1. Create a server.js file\nLet's build our server! Before we do anything, let's create a new file called server.js. This is where all our server code is going to live.\n2. require the express library\nWe already installed Express in Step 2, but we need to make sure it is included in this file specifically so we can make use of its methods. In Node.js, when you want to access the functionality of a library or module in another file, you require it.\nTo import Express, write the following inside server.js:\nconst express = require('express');\n\n\nWe will try and get used to ES6 syntax - so use const and let instead of var.\n\n3. Initialise the server\nTo initialise our server, we just need to call the express() function. This will create an Express application for us to work with.\nAdd the second line of code to your server.js file:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\n4. Start 'listening' for potential requests\nOne more step left, we need to set a port for our server to listen to. Think of a port as a door number; any requests that come to the server will come via that door. Setting a port will allow us to find where our server is running.\nWe use the app.listen method to do this. This method takes two arguments: a port and a callback function telling it what to do once the server is running. Need clarification? Read more about the app.listen method in the Express documentation.\nWe're going to run our server on port 3000, and run a simple console.log as our callback function. Update your server.js file, calling the app.listen method:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log('Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!');\n});\n\n\nTry to use ES6 arrow functions instead of function.\n\n5. Switch the server on!\nYou've built your server, but it isn't running yet. We need to run a command in the terminal to do this. We are going to use the node keyword to run the server file.\nType the following command in your terminal:\n$ node server.js\nIf you see this, congratulations! You have built yourself a server!\n\nStep 4 - Communicating with the server\nNow that we've built the server, we need to communicate with it. We're going to control the server with handler functions.\nWhat is a handler function?\nWhen a request reaches the server, we need a way of responding to it. In comes the handler function. The handler function is just a function which receives requests and handles them, hence the name.\nThe handler function always takes a request and response object, and sends the response back to the client along with some information. You can decide what to send back in your response.\nWhat does a handler function look like in Express?\nThe get() method is used to define a handler function in Express. It takes two parameters: the endpoint at which to trigger an action (we'll explain more about this in the next step), and the handler function that tells it exactly what to do. Here's a simple \"Hello World!\" example:\n// req is the Request object, res is the Response object\n// (these are just variable names, they can be anything but it's a convention to call them req and res)\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n    res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\n Here, we are telling our server to respond with \"Hello World!\" when someone tries to access the webpage.\n1. Create your own handler function.\nWe are now making a handler function with a custom message in our response. You can write any message you want.\nUpdate your server.js file with an empty app.get() function:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Try to console.log the request object inside the handler function. Restart your server, refresh the browser, then go to your terminal to see what it looks like. You should see a lot of data come through.\n\n2. Tell your handler function what to do\nWe want our handler function to send back a message to the client. To do that, we're going to use the Express send() method. This will update the response object with the message.\nUpdate your handler function like so:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Yay Node Girls!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n3. Check it out in your browser\nQuit your server in the terminal with ctrl + c. Then restart it to run your new changes.\n$ node server.js\nNow, open your favourite browser (we like Chrome), and navigate to http://localhost:3000. If you see your message in the browser, congratulations! You just sent your first response from the server.\nStep 5 - Routing\nAt the moment our server only does one thing. When it receives a request from the / endpoint, it sends back the same response: \"Yay Node Girls!\".\n\nTry typing http://localhost:3000/nodegirls and see what happens.\n\nHowever by making use of endpoints, we can make the server send different responses for different requests. This concept is called routing.\nWhat is an endpoint?\nAn endpoint is the part of the URL which comes after /. For example: /chocolate is the \"chocolate\" endpoint. It's the URL to which you send a request.\nWhat is URL?\n\n1. Create your own endpoints and send different responses\nWe're going to try sending different responses at different endpoints. Remember the app.get() method? To set up routing in your server, we just need to repeat this method with different endpoints.\nFor example:\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n    res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.get(\"/chocolate\", function (req, res) {\n    res.send(\"Mm chocolate :O\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add some code so that your server sends one message when the endpoint is /node and another one when it's /girls.\n\nStep 6 - Serving static files\nSo we know how to send back a simple message. But what if you want to send back a whole HTML page, or an image?\nThings like HTML files, images etc are known as static assets. If you want your server to \"serve\" static assets back to the browser, you need to do something different than just using the res.send() method.\nTo be able to send any file from the server we need a special, built-in middleware function that comes with Express: express.static(). Read more about it here.\nSay we want to serve all the static assets in our \"public\" folder. The express.static() function will look like this:\napp.use(express.static(\"public\"));\n\n1. Serve static files from your server\nDelete all your app.get endpoint functions, and replace them with the line of code above. Restart your server, refresh your browser and see what happens! If you see a Node Girls CMS, then your static assets have been successfully served.\nHTTP request methods\nAll requests use one of the HTTP methods. The main ones are: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\napp.get deals with requests that use the GET HTTP method.\n\nWe will go into these Methods into more details, but for now, think of GET as a method for Getting data. POST is for POSTing/inserting new data. PUT is for updating. DELETE is for deleting data.\n\nThe POST http request method\nWhen sending data to the server, we use the POST http request method, instead of GET.\nLet's try POSTing some text to the server.\nWe're going to add a form to the index.html page, so that you can write your blogposts from there.\nOpen up the index.html file in your text editor.  If you have a look, you should see this:\n\n    \n\n\nReplace the greyed-out comment with this code snippet:\nCreate a blog post\n\n    \n    Send\n\n\n\nThis form has a text area and a Send button.\nThe action attribute is the endpoint form data will be sent to.\nThe name attribute will be used later to reference the data.\n\nWhen you hit Send, the form will send a POST request to the server, using whatever is in the action attribute as the endpoint.  In our case it's /create-post.\n\nExercise: Open Chrome Developers tool, click the button and see what happens.\n\nReceiving the blog post on the server\n\nData doesn't come through the server in one go; it flows to the server in a stream.  Think of a stream as water flowing from a tap into a bucket.  Your job is to collect this water in the server.\n\nIf we were writing a pure Node server, we would have to think about how to collect the stream of data properly.  But luckily for us, Express handles all of that stuff under the hood.\n\nAll you need to do is define a route to deal with requests that come through on the /create-post endpoint.\n\n\nLet's remind ourselves of a simple GET route in Express:\napp.get('/hello-world', function (req, res) {\n    res.send('Hello there!');\n});\n\n\nExercise: This time we want to define a route to deal with a POST request not a GET.  What do you think you would need to do differently?  Experiment and see if you can define a route for the /create-post endpoint!\nFor now, make your /create-post handler simply do this: console.log('I am /create-post endpoint').\n\n\nExtracting the blog post\nNow the contents of your blogpost is hidden in your req object somewhere.  Normally you would extract it using req.body.  Try to console.log req.body now.\nGetting undefined?  Not to worry, that's normal.  When data has been POSTed to the server as FormData, we need to do things slightly differently to access the data that's come through in the request.\nWe need another middleware function.  Something that can get extract the contents out of the special FormData object.  For this we will use express-formidable.  express-formidable is another Express middleware. It will extract the form data from the request and make it available to you when you do req.fields.\nThis time though, express-formidable is not built-in, we need to explicitly install it.\nIn your terminal, install express-formidable\nnpm install express-formidable --save\n\nrequire express-formidable so you can use it in your code.  You can't use dashes in JavaScript variable names, so just call it const formidable.\nconst formidable = require('express-formidable');\n\nNow add this towards the top of your server, after your requires and app.use(express.static('public')), but before your /create-post endpoint:\napp.use(formidable());\n\nNow inside your /create-post function, add:\nconsole.log(req.fields);\n\nRefresh your server and have another go at writing a blogpost.\nYou should now see an object in the console.  The key should be blogpost, just like the name attribute in the form on the HTML page.  The value of blogpost will be your message!\n\nExercise: Try putting app.use(formidable()); at the end of the file (after the create-post but before starting the server)\nWhat is a middleware in Express? Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware. Read more on the Express documentation\n\nStep 8 - Saving your blog post\nRight now, your precious blog posts aren't being saved anywhere, which is a bit of a shame.  Let's do something about that.\nYou'll note that in the data folder there's a new file called posts.json.\nIf you look at posts.json will see there's already one blog post there. The format is:\n{\n    [timestamp]: [blog post message]\n}\n\nWe've used a timestamp as the key so that the blog posts are listed in chronological order. Also, it's a record of when the blog post was created.\nWriting to your hard drive\nAnytime a blog post comes through to the server, we want to save the data on your computer's hard drive.  To do this, we need to use a built-in Node module: fs, which stands for 'file-system'.\nBuilt-in Node modules - core Node modules - are rather like the built-in Express middleware functions.  Only difference is that where you need to have installed Express to use Express middleware functions, the core Node modules come automatically with Node itself.\nTo use fs, you'll need to require it at the top of your server file:\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nThe method we need to write to your hard drive is fs.writeFile.\nfs.writeFile('path/to/file', yourData, function (error) {\n    // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to write to\nArgument 2: the data you want to write\nArgument 3: the callback function\n\nThe 'path/to/file' will be replaced with the actual path to the file you want to write to.  If it doesn't exist, fs.writeFile cleverly creates one for you.  But we already have posts.json, so not to worry.\nReading from your hard drive\nTo read data that's already there, you would use fs.readFile.  The way to use fs.readFile is very similar to fs.writeFile:\nfs.readFile('path/to/file', function (error, file) {\n    // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to write to\nArgument 2: the callback function\n\nYou'll notice that fs.readFile's callback function takes a second argument.  That argument would be the file you're reading.\nLet's read the data from the posts.json file.  Make sure you've required the fs core Node module at the top of your server file somewhere.\nAdd this code to your server (put it anywhere after the requires for now):\nfs.readFile(__dirname + '/data/posts.json', function (error, file) {\n\n    console.log(file);\n});\n\n(__dirname is a Node global object that gives you a path to current working directory. It's handy if we want to avoid writing the whole path out in full.)\nIf you restart the server, you'll probably see something like this:\n\n\nThis is actually the contents of your posts.json file, but in a format called a buffer.  To make it a bit more human-readable, you can console.log the file to a string, like this:\nconsole.log(file.toString());\n\nfile is in JSON format right now.  If we want to access the blog post message inside file, we need to parse it from JSON back to a JavaScipt object.\nAdd this next bit of code to your fs.readFile's callback function:\nconst parsedFile = JSON.parse(file);\n\nNow parsedFile is a normal JavaScript object, and we can access the data inside it.\nOk, so we've talked about JSON and we've talked about reading and writing files.  You now have the power to save new blog post data to your hard drive!  Work with your partner and your mentor to see if you can figure the next steps out on your own.\nHere's a breakdown of what you want to achieve:\n\nWhen new blog post data comes through, read from posts.json to access its contents\nAdd your new blog post data to the old ones.\nWrite your new combined data back to the posts.json file.\n\nThings to remember\n\nfs.writeFile() normally overwrites the target file you've given it.  Chances are you don't want to lose all your old blog posts every time you get a new one, so think about how you can combine fs.readFile() and fs.writeFile() to prevent overwriting.\n\nYou will need to convert between JSON and a JavaScript object several times.  JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() are what you need.\n\n\nOh by the way, if you want to get the current timestamp, use the JavaScript Date.now() method.\nStep 9 - Displaying your blog posts\nSo now we're saving the blog posts to the server.  Time to get them and display them on the page!\nIf you look inside public/script.js, there's a whole bunch of JavaScript code in there.  Don't worry about what all the code means, just know that it's responsible for sending a request to GET old blog posts and display them on the page underneath \"Recent Posts\".\nscript.js is trying to load existing posts by making a GET request. Look inside script.js and see if you can find any useful endpoints.\nYour script.js file will want to receive the JSON containing your blog posts.  Your job is to make that happen!\nExpress has a handy method called res.sendFile() that makes it easy to send files back to the client.  Feel free to use this with your JSON.\nIf all goes well, you should have a fully functional CMS!\n"},"node/templating.html":{"url":"node/templating.html","title":"Templating","keywords":"","body":"Templating\n\nExercise: Let's change the text for the link, Contact, to Contact Information.\n\n- How many files do you have to change? Wouldn't be nice if we could change one file and that reflects in all pages.\nAt the moment, we're just serving static HTML files from the public folder. NodeJS and ExpressJS allows us to build dynamic web pages.\n\nA server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server that processes server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nWebsites - a small detour\nWhat is wrong with this website?\nIs this one any better?\nThe final view is here\nWhat was missing in the first example?\n\nSo what is the point of all these?\n\nTemplate Engines\nA template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page, as it reduces duplicate code (DRY).\nSome popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache, and EJS.\nHandlebars Templating Engine\nWe will use Handlebars as the templating engine for this class.\nTo add it to your project:\nnpm install --save express-handlebars\nThen in your server.js, we need to configure the middleware for Handlebars.\n\n// Add this to the top of your file\nconst exphbs  = require('express-handlebars');\n\n// Then these two lines after you initialise your express app\napp.engine('handlebars', exphbs({ defaultLayout: 'main' }));\napp.set('view engine', 'handlebars');\n\n\nLet's look at the folder views/layouts/main.handlebars\n\n\nThere is a placeholder for body where the \"body\" get injected - can you find it?\nNotice the index.handlebars, my-cv.handlebars and admin.handlebars.\n\nThen add these routes:\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n    res.render('index');\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add similar endpoints for /my-cv and /admin.\nExercise: Let's create a template called contact and delete the endpoint we created earlier for /contact - render a view instead - similar to what we did with the previous endpoints.\nExercise: Remember how we changed Contact to Contact Information? Try to change now Contact Information to Get in touch. Was it any easier?\n\nTemplate passing info from Controller to Template\nWhen we were using the static HTML pages from public/ folder - the heading text shown on top of the page (on the photo) used to change when we go to different pages. Now that we switched to the template, we've lost that behavior as the code for this part comes from the centralised Layout (views/layouts/main.handlebars).\nHow can we imitate that behavior without having to duplicate code or serve static files? Express and Handlebars allow you to pass data between the routes and the views. Here is how we can do it:\n\nLet's modify the / route to pass the title of the page.\n app.get('/', function (req, res) {\n     res.render('index', {\n         title: 'Etzali Profile', // insert your name instead\n     });\n });\n\n\nIn /views/layouts/main.handlebars, let's use the data we're passing to the template\n \n     \n         \n             \n             \n             \n             A modern Website built in Node\n         \n     \n \n\n\n\n\nExercise: Pass the subheading from the route to the view as well.\nExercise: Change Title to default to \"My Profile\" if no title was provided. Look at #if helpers for Handlebars http://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html\n\nPartials\nHandlebars allows for template reuse through partials. Partials are normal Handlebars templates that may be called directly by other templates. (Handlebars documentation)\nLet's put the Menu in a partial.\n\nGo to layout/main.handlebars and cut the  with all its contents, and move it to a new file called menu.handlebars under views/partials.\n\nThen to use the partial, add {{> menu}} in the place where you cut the original menu from.\nMore Templating\nThere is much more that can be done with Handlebars templating engine. Skim through the express-handlebars and handlebars documentation\nFor now, we will finish by using the each helper.\nDynamically loading the templates\n{{#each posts}}\n    \n        \n            \n                {{this.title}}\n            \n            \n                {{this.summary}}\n            \n        \n    \n{{/each}}\n\nIn the route, let's load the file in data/posts.json:\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n    const filePath = __dirname + '/data/posts.json';\n    const callbackFunction = function(error, file) {\n        // we call .toString() to turn the file buffer to a String\n        const fileData = file.toString();\n        // we use JSON.parse to get an object out the String\n        const postsJson = JSON.parse(fileData);\n        // send the json to the Template to render\n        res.render('index', {\n          title: 'Etzali Profile', // insert your name instead\n          posts: postsJson\n        });\n    };\n    fs.readFile(filePath, callbackFunction);\n});\n\n"},"node/callbacks.html":{"url":"node/callbacks.html","title":"Callbacks","keywords":"","body":"Callbacks\nIn JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. That means they can be used in a first class manner like any other object since they are objects themselves. We can pass them as arguments to functions which is common technique in JavaScript for dealing with asynchronous behaviour. We have in fact already encountered callbacks when we looked at array methods such as .forEach(), .map() and .filter.\nconst evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];\nevenNumbers.forEach(function( num ) {\n    console.log(num);\n});\n\nHere we are passing the function( num ) {console.log(num);} function as an argument to .forEach() to execute with each item in the array evenNumbers.\nThe above example is synchronous which means that code the callback is executed immediately. Let's look at an example where the code is executed asynchronously. We will use a setTimeout function to delay execution here. In most JavaScript applications asynchronous code execution could be in response to an event such as mouse click or data coming back from a server. We will look at both of those cases in detail in a future class.\nfunction delay(callback){\n    setTimeout( callback, 2000 );\n}\n\nfunction logRandom(){\n    const value = Math.round( Math.random() * 10);\n    console.log( value );\n    return value;\n}\n\ndelay(logRandom);\n\nKey points\n\nFunctions can be passed as arguments to other other function\nFunctions that are passed as arguments are called callbacks\nCallbacks may be executed immediately or later\nIf a callback is executed later, its return value is lost\n\n\nExercise: What other Asynchronous operations have we recently used in the Node code we've written?\nExercise: On the CV page, there is a button, Get Repos List, that doesn't work.

Refactor the anonymous functions to their own variables and use the variables instead. (Bonus point if you use arrow functions)\n\nCallback hell\nIn the code where we retrieve the repos data from Github, imagine if we had a requirement, that for each repo retrieved, we have to make another API call to retrieve all the available branches (there is a property called branches_url that we can use to get that info). And then, once we have all the branches, make another API call to get the info for each branch.\nThe code to do so, will look something similar to this:\nvar oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\noReq.addEventListener('load', function() {\n    var oReq2 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    oReq2.addEventListener('load', function() {\n        var oReq3 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        oReq2.addEventListener('load', function() {\n            // 4. Now we finally have all the info we need and we can the info we retrieved from the three API calls.\n\n        });\n        oReq3.open('GET', url); // 3. third url for branch info\n        oReq3.send();\n    });\n    oReq.open('GET', url); // 2. second url for branches\n    oReq.send();\n});\noReq.open('GET', url); // 1. first url for Repo\noReq.send();\n\nThe code above is very hard to understand and follow.

React provides a thin layer on top of JavaScript and HTML to allow you to build custom components. These components can encapsulate (hide within them) behavior and style and can be re-used throughout your application and even exported for others to use. \nWe already have some existing components in HTML. When you write this:\n\n\n..it generates this: \n\nAn \"input\" box, that only supports numbers, with a set of up/down arrows for changing the value, and a pre-defined value of 5. So the element tag tells the browser which element to render, and the attributes specify the settings for that element and any information we want to pass into it.\nWhy React?\nBesides providing the tools to build powerful and well encapsulated components, React also takes care of updating the HTML code to match our data.\nSuppose you make an HTTP GET request to \"http://blog.com/post?id=123\" and you store the result in a variable:\nvar post = { id: '123', title: 'Post 1', content: 'Lorem ipsum 1' };\n\nAnd our HTML looks like this:\n\n\n\nAs we've learned, we can dynamically insert content into our HTML using JavaScript:\ndocument.querySelector('#title').innerText = post.title;\ndocument.querySelector('#content').innerText = post.content;\n\nSo every time our post variable changes, we have to manually call the above to update our HTML, so the user can actually see the new post.\nHowever, with React, you can just set up your component once:\n{post.title}\n{post.content}\n\nAnd then whenever there's a change to post, React will take care of changing the DOM to match our new data.\n\nExercise: \nWhat does the above HTML remind you of?

So instead of returning the JSX directly, it's returned as part of a render() function.

Encourage short explanations of different students to make sure they followed the class and know what they are doing.\nMake sure people connecting remotely have screen sharing (e.g. using Airtame).\nRequest the mentor of the previous class to include any reading material as preparation for the class.\n\nTeaching methodology:\n\nSpeak slowly and support explanation with visuals, board, screen.\nAsk questions to different students in the class (Note: do not rely on group questions that nobody answers/ same people answer).\nDivide the class in different segments.\nCheck that supporting mentors are helping all students.\nFind simple language to explain, speak slowly, gesture.\nLook for analogies in simple drawings, make use of whiteboard.\n\nTimetable  Example\n\nCode review (let different people present their work, group feedback, good intro to new concepts) @12.30pm ~30mins\nIntroduce New concepts (visual, including non-coding images for each concept) + short practical exercises @1pm ~20mins x 3 \nCoding (working alone and in pairs with longer exercises) ~1.5h – \n(break for lunch around 2.30pm for 30min)\nGroup discussion (what remains unclear) ~15min\nNew assignment explanation ~15mins\n\nAssignments (Homework) Guidelines\n\nIt should include 4 different areas:\nReadings and videos reinforcing the concepts and preparing for the next class (blogs, youtube, chapters of books, etc)\nComplete some online coding tutorials (FCC, sololearn, codewars, etc)\nCreative Coding task (with answers that can’t be found easily online)\nReview each other’s code\n\n\n\nNote: Assignment should be uploaded in the repository before the end of the class and explained in group.\nTips from codebar http://www.codebar.io/effective-teacher-guide\n\nYou don't need a laptop for our workshops. You are there to watch and guide the students. If you don't feel comfortable with the tutorial you should spend time on it before coming if you want to help out.\nDo not take over the keyboard! This can be off-putting and scary.\nEncourage the students to type and not copy paste.\nExplain that there are no dumb questions.\nExplain to students that it's OK to make mistakes.\nAlways introduce yourself. Say why you want to help out and are spending your own time on this, why you like programming.\nGive your students the opportunity to get to know each other. Ask their names, why they are here, what they do in their day jobs. Encourage a brief discussion before starting.\nAssume that anyone you're teaching has no knowledge but infinite intelligence.\nWork collaboratively with your student. If you have two students, you should work with both. Don't focus all your attention on one of them.\nLet students have a go at answering the questions first. Help with open and leading questions. Encourage a discussion.\nTake it slow, you are the teacher, they are the student. Allow for time between questions.\nDon't say no when the students are not doing something right. Be gentle, approach it in a mild way.\nUse pen and paper or go to a whiteboard! Often students are coming from a non-technical background. Drawing and explaining with visual material is really helpful.\nLet them stumble. We learn by making mistakes, getting frustrated, and working through problem in our own way. Be supportive, but let them explore.\n\n"},"lesson-template.html":{"url":"lesson-template.html","title":"Lesson Template","keywords":"","body":"   (have one of these badges on top of your Lessons and follow the guidelines/workflow defined in this issue)\n[Class name]\n What we will learn today?\n\nTopic 1\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nTopic 4\n\n\nTopic 1\nHigh level explanation of Topic 1 - rely on the exercises\n\nExercise: Always have exercises\n\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nResources\n\nResource 1 to learn more about Topic 1\nResource 2 for Topic 2\n\nHomework\n\nFirst part of Homework - Easy\n\nSecond part of Homework - Intermediate/Hard\n\n[Bonus/Optional] Third part/optional - Hardest\n\nResearch:\n\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nRead this Some Tutorial or Video etc...\n\n"}}}
