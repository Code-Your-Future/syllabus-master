is the course material for Code Your Future, a\nnot-for-profit volunteer-run coding school for refugees and asylum seekers.\nDuring the course you will learn a technology stack that helps you build anything from a simple website to a powerful database-driven web application or even a mobile app! The six-months course starts with HTML/CSS then core JavaScript, backend development using NodeJS, and modern front-end development with React. Weâ€™ll complement the training with workshops on modern software methodologies and job interview practices etc...\nUnder Construction\nThis is the repo for the updated CYF Syllabus.\nFor the version that is being taught in our first London class, please check Syllabus-book\n"},"others/lesson0.html":{"url":"others/lesson0.html","title":"Week 0","keywords":"","body":"\nLesson 0\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nCodeYourFuture\nWelcome task\nTerminal\nGit\nIDEs\nHomework\n\n\nCodeYourFuture\n\nWho we are?\nWhat we learn?\nRead this Technology Survey from StackOverflow. Pay particular attention to the technologies we'll be teaching you (JavaScript, React, NodeJS)\n\n\nHouse Rules\nHow we work?\nHow we treat each other?\n\n\nStandup\n\nWelcome!\nWelcome to CodeYourFuture and to the world of Web Development! Now that you have built\na website in CodePen and learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it's time to learn about\nthe tools that web developers use in their everyday job. These tools will be used during\nthe course, so it is important that you become familiarised with them.\nIn order to get started, we would like you to try to complete a task at home: move your\nCodePen website to a web address under https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name.\nIn the process, you will learn how to store your code outside CodePen's website, in a location\nwhere other developers can make changes to it and view a history of all the updates that\nyou have made.\nIf you wish to learn more about the concepts behind the steps we are suggesting below,\nplease read the rest of this document.\nAnd remember: it's ok if you are stuck and don't know how to continue. At any point, please\nask for a mentor's help. We will cover these steps again in the lesson, and will explain\nthem in more detail.\nHow to move your website to Github.io\n\nExport your website as a zip from CodePen. Help >\nExtract the contents of the zip file to a folder in your computer. Keep note of the\nlocation of this folder.\nRead about the terminal.\nRead about git.\nInstall Git.\nPut the contents of the zip folder in a Gitub repository. How does Github work? (30min) >\nYou should now have a page with your code under http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.\nThis is a view of your code, and you should see a list of your files, including an index.html.\nNow all that remains is to publish your website! Still under http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name,\nfind the settings icon in the top right corner.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFind the section named \"Github Pages\" and select \"master branch\" in source, then hit\n\"Save\".\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWait a few minutes, then refresh the page and come back to the Github Pages section.\nYou should see a green bar saying \"Your site is published at http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name\".\nClick the link, verify that your website is there, then share it with your CYF class!\n\nTerminal basics\nDuring your course journey and onwards, the terminal (also known as command line)\nwill be one of your most valuable tools. It will help you to interact with you computer\nfaster, by helping you to:\n\nCreate and delete files.\nInstall web development tools.\nStart a server.\nUse source control (explained later in this lesson).\n\nAll this will make sense as we progress with the lessons. For now, we would like you\nto get familiar with it by following this tutorial:\n\nLearn the command line >\n\nHow do I use it on my computer?\nSo now that you know what the terminal can do for you, how do you use it? Please find\ninstructions for your operating system below. After you have followed the instructions,\nopen a terminal and write ls, then press the Enter key. You will see something\nlike this:\n\n  \n\n\nLinux\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications available in\nyour computer. More instructions >\nmacOS (Apple)\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications available in\nyour computer. More instructions >\nWindows\nInstall Git. It will bring with it a tool called \"Git Bash\".\nWhen the mentors ask you to open a terminal or command line, please open \"Git Bash\".\nGit\nWe will use Git as our Version Control System (also known as Source Control). It's\nlike Dropbox for developers. But much better!\n\nWhat is \"version control\"? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.\nIt allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\nExtract from Git Pro book\n\nThis answer on StackOverflow by si618 explains very well why we use Version Control.\nSo what is Git? Git is one of many Version Control Systems available to use, and by far the most popular.\nWhat is Github? Github is a very popular site where you can publish and share your Git repositories, share and collaborate with other people.\nGet Started\nFollow this tutorial from Github to setup Git https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/\nThen learn how to use git from the Terminal >\nTry completing this tutorial > as well to learn more intermediate features, like branching.\nA typical workflow\n\nIf you're basing your work from another project, the first step is typically to fork their repo. Read this guide for instructions (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)\n\nIf you're starting a new project then you should follow these steps https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/\n\n\nUsing Git through the Terminal\n\ngit init if it is a new project, i.e. a project not cloned from a repo (or a fork of a repo)\ngit add . to add local files to the index\ngit commit -m \"Good explanation of your file changes\" to commit files to the local repo\ngit remote add origin GitRepoRemoteUrl if it is a new project (to setup the remote url)\ngit remote -v to verify that the remote url is set correctly\ngit push -u origin master to push your commits to the remote url (Github in our case)\n\nYou will also typically need to set up your email and name once when you install Git git config --global user.name  and git config --global user.email .\nUsing Git through a graphical interface\nIf you don't feel comfortable with the terminal just yet, download the\nGithub client. If possible, however, we recommend becoming \ncomfortable with the Terminal commands and understanding the steps for the different \nworkflows before moving on to visual Git clients.\nGithub client guides >\nPull Requests\nYou should also learn how to create and work with Pull Requests.\nGithub\nDuring our course, we will be using Github to store our code.\nGithub is the most popular Git service around, and is used by many large companies,\nlike Facebook, Airbnb and The Guardian.\nCodeYourFuture's Github page >\nMore Resources\n\nFollow this tutorial to learn the basic Git commands https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git\nAnother good resource: Git - the simple guide\nhttp://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\nA more detailed tutorial that goes into advanced topics of Git - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control\nYou can also check this visual explanation of different commands and what they do: http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace\nThere are GUI software - Gitkraken is one of them https://www.gitkraken.com/\nThis Glossary has definitions of the terms normally used with Git: https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/\n\nIDE\nIDE stands for \"Integrated Development Environment\". It is the software that you will\nbe using to write most of your code. It is designed to help you develop your apps\nquickly, focusing on the problems that you need to solve instead of having to search\nGoogle for minor details.\nAuto-complete\nOne of the most important features of an IDE is that it provides \"auto-completion\".\nThis means that it will give you suggestions of what you can can write next, while\nyou are typing something.\nFor example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can assign\nit to.\n\n  \n\n\nFile tree view\nThe reason why we call it \"Integrated\" is that you almost don't need to leave the\nwindow to write your app. For example, creating, renaming and moving files can be\ndone directly from the IDE. This functionality can be achieved from something called\na \"Tree view\", which you can usually find on the left side of your IDE.\n\n  \n\n\nFinding files\nWhen working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly, without\nhaving to go through the tree view manually.\n\n  \n\n\nMost IDEs will allow you to do this with a sequence of keys.\nVSCode sequence: Windows/Linux Ctrl + P | Mac Cmd + P\nInstall an IDE\nFor this course, we recommend the usage of VS Code. Please\ngo ahead and install it, then try opening an HTML file with it via File > Open.\nInstall VS Code >\nOther IDEs\nBesides VS Code, the IDEs below are also popular with web developers. Feel free to check out their\nwebsites and see the differences between them and VS Code.\n\nAtom\nWebstorm\n\nHomework\n\nIf you have not yet moved your website from CodePen to Github, do it now. Please use the\ninformation in this section to complete it.\nWhen your website is live at https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name, please send\na link to the slack channel of your class.\nLearn how to navigate your computer using a Terminal (view files, copy files).\nInstall VS Code.\nOpen your website with VS Code and add something to it: text, images, update CSS.\nCommit your changes to Github and verify that https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name\nhas been updated!\n\nIt's alright if you are getting stuck or if something doesn't look right!\nWhen it happens, please ask your mentors or classmates for help in Slack.\n"},"html-css/week-01/lesson.html":{"url":"html-css/week-01/lesson.html","title":"Week 1 - Semantic HTML and CSS","keywords":"","body":" \nHTML/CSS 1\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nSemantic HTML tags\nCSS selectors, CSS cascade, Pseudo-classes such as :hover/:focus\nBox model: margin/padding/border etc...\nCSS specificity\n\n\nWhat makes a web page?\n\nSeparation of Concerns: In computer science, separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. (Wikipedia)\n\nPrinciples - During the course, we will highlight principles that apply to the specific topic but also to Computer Science and Programming in general. It is important to understand these principles, terms and apply them to your thinking in general.\n\nHTML Syntax\nYou're already familiar with HTML code from your application process. If you want to refresh your memory, read this quick guide to the HTML syntax.\nAll together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example:\n\n    Learning HTML\n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\n\nExercise Which parts are the Tags and which parts are the Attributes.\n\nHTML tags are arranged in a hierarchy. This is sometimes called \"nesting\" tags or creating an HTML \"tree\". Between the opening  tag and the closing  tag there are three other tags. We call these \"child\" tags, because they have a parent-child relationship.\n\n\nExercise As a group, let's try to name all of the parent and child tags in the following example.\n\n\n    Learning HTML\n    \n        Author:\n        Code Your Future\n    \n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\nExample HTML/CSS Project\nIn today's class, we will begin adapting styles on this example website. We'll review some of the HTML/CSS basics you already encountered during your application process and learn some new techniques. By the end of the third lesson, we will have worked together to improve the example site on the left so that it looks like the screenshot on the right.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nThe example website you'll begin working with is available on this GitHub repository. Fork the repository to your personal account and use the following terminal commands to download the files to your projects folder.\n\ncd ~\ncd \ngit clone git@github.com:/bikes-for-refugees.git\n\n\nExercise: Spend a few minutes exploring the .html and .css files for this page. Why don't we put everything in one file?\n\nSemantic HTML\nWhen writing HTML code, you can use different tags to describe the content. Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.\n\nSemantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Wikipedia\n\nWe'll cover the following semantic tags:\n\n\n\nThe role=\"main\" attribute\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise (pair programming):  Work in pairs to determine where to place these new Tags and Attributes in the index.html file. Who benefits when we write \"semantic\" HTML?\n\nCSS Selectors\nDuring your application process, you became familiar with CSS selectors. We'll review the basic selectors and then practice combining these to modify our button styles.\n\nIf you want to review the selectors, read the Common Selectors section of this page.\nExercise (pair programming): Work in pairs to make the blue buttons on the page red (#ce5f31). The white button, which says \"Volunteer\", should remain white but the text should change to red.\n\nCSS Inheritance\nSome CSS styles applied to one element will be \"inherited\" by their child elements. These are usually styles which apply to the content of the elements, such as font family and color. Other properties, like margins, paddings and borders, don't get passed down to children.\n\nIn English, the word inherit refers to something, like the color of your eyes, which you can receive from your parent. We use this to describe how \"child\" HTML elements can inherit styles from \"parent\" HTML elements.\n\nWe'll do two quick exercises to explore what gets inherited, what doesn't, and why.\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the background properties to add a assets/jumbotron-background.jpg to the jumbotron. Did these styles have \"inheritance\"? Why do you think they did or did not?\n\nNow that the background image is in place, the text is difficult to read. The text needs to be white.\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use just one CSS rule to set all of the text in the jumbotron to white. To do this, you'll need to use inheritance. Why do you think some styles, like text color, get inherited?\n\nPseudo Classes\nYou can assign CSS rules to a class like this:\n.btn {\n    background: #ce5f31;\n}\n\nThere are also things called \"pseudo\" classes. In this section, we'll introduce you to the common pseudo classes for assigning styles to interactions, such as moving your mouse over a link.\n\n\"pseudo\" is a fancy word for \"fake\". We call them \"pseudo\" classes because they're not really there in the HTML, but the browser knows what to do with them.\n\nHere's an example of a pseudo class which changes the color of a link when the mouse moves over it.\n.btn:hover {\n    background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\nNot everyone uses a mouse. Some users will prefer a keyboard, where they can hit tab to move between links on a page. So that they can see where they are, you should add effects to the :focus pseudo class too.\n.btn:hover,\n.btn:focus {\n    background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the pseudo classes to make the background color of the red buttons change when in a \"hover\" or \"focus\" state. See if you can make the white \"Volunteer\" button change to a different background without effecting the red buttons.\n\nThe Cascade\nCSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The \"cascade\" is a set of rules which the browser uses to choose what to do when two CSS rules conflict. Take the following example:\n.btn {\n    color: red;\n}\n.btn {\n    color: blue;\n}\n\nShould the .btn be red or blue? When identical selectors are next to each other like this, the browser lets the last one override the first one. But in a real-world scenario, you may have CSS scattered across different files. To solve this, we use the cascade.\n\nExercise: Read the section on the cascade. Then pair up. In the example, there are two paragraphs. Pick one paragraph and explain to your partner why it has a particular background color. Then ask your partner to explain the other paragraph.\nExercise: Work in pairs to give each one of the navigation menu items a red border (#ce5f31). This border should only appear when the mouse is hovering over it or the item has focus. Then use what you've learned about the cascade to give the first navigation menu item (\"Home\") a different color border.\n\nBox Model\nIn CSS, everything is a box. An image is a box. A link is a box. The area around this box can be modified with properites that we call margins, borders and padding. Here's a diagram showing what the box looks like.\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the margin and padding rules to spread your navigation links out a bit wider. There should be a small gap between them and enough padding so that the border is not too tight on the text.\n\nYou may have noticed that the border you added to the navigation links causes the links to jump around when you move your mouse over them. That's because the border is adding to the width of the box model, pushing the others to the side.\nYou can also set a transparent border, so that it takes up the space without showing a visible border.\n.navlink {\n    border: 1px solid transparent;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Use a transparent border so that the width of each navigation menu item stays the same even when it is hovered or focused.\n\nResources\n\nHTML5 - semantic elements\nCSS Selectors - MDN\nThe Cascade - MDN\nBox Model - MDN\nBox Model, box-sizing: border-box - CSS Tricks\nCSS specificity - MDN\nPseudo classes - MDN\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 2 hours) Read about advanced CSS selectors and then practice by playing this CSS selector game.

To ensure we're presenting a website that's easy to use on any device, we use Responsive Web Design techniques to modify how content is displayed depending on the viewport.\n\nExercise: As a group, let's brainstorm as many devices as we can think of which might access the websites we build.\n\nSee how much variety there is in viewport sizes.\nMedia Queries\nAs you learned in your homework assignment, media queries help us change the display of our content depending on the size of the viewport. Let's review what you learned and break down a media query:\n@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n    body {\n        background: red;\n    }\n}\n\nIn this media query, we're assigning a red background color to the  element whenever the viewport is larger than 900px, and we're viewing on a screen.\n\n@media starts the media query\nscreen tells it to apply these styles to screen displays. Other displays might be print, for when a webpage is being printed.\n(min-width: 900px) tells it to apply these styles when the viewport is larger than 900px\n\nFinally, we wrap all of our styles for this media query in brackets ({ and }), just like a CSS rule.\n\nExercise: Working in pairs, reduce the size of the \"Bikes for Refugees\" text so that it fits on a small screen (320px). But make sure it increases in size on larger screens.\nExercise: The two buttons in the jumbotron don't fit on the same line on small screens around 320px wide. Can you adjust their size so that they fit on the same line?\n\nContent Layout: Flexbox\nFlexbox is a name for a set of CSS layout rules which are supported in newer browsers. They allow you to apply rules to elements to place them side-by-side and re-arrange them. You just specify how you want your elements arranged and the browser will scale this arrangement depending on the screen size and device used for viewing.\nMost flexbox rules are applied to the container, to tell it how to arrange its children. However, there are some rules that can be applied to children as well.\nYou can see all the rules that can be applied to both the container and the children here:\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\n\nExercise: Continue editing the \"Bike for refugees\" website by adding 3 boxes below Jumbotron, and using Flexbox, make sure they are arranged like in the sketch below:\n\nIf you finish early, you can add some text in each box and position it in the middle of the box.\nExercise: Working independently, try to position the articles and images side-by-side under the \"Upcoming Events\" section. Use this screenshot to guide you. If you get stuck, go ahead and ask your partner. Never be afraid to ask!\nHint: you might need to create a container for the text pieces!\n\nLet's take a break from flexbox for a minute. Do you remember the :first-child psuedo class? There's a :last-child psuedo class as well.\n\nExercise: See if you can use these psuedo classes to give the left box a grey background (#ddd) and the right box a grey border (1px solid #ddd). Use this screenshot to guide you.\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete the \"Common Responsive Patterns\" lesson of the Responsive Web Design Fundamentals course.\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete as many levels of the Flexbox Froggy game as you can. This will stretch your knowledge of Flexbox and you may need to do some research. It's ok if you can't complete all levels. Do as many as you can.\n(Est. 3 hours) Complete as many levels as you can from Flexbox Zombies\n(Est. 2-3 hours) Continue working on the webpage you created in last week's homework assignment. Add a sidebar to your site and move the site description into it. When viewing on a small screen, this should appear below the articles. On a larger screen, it should switch to a two-column layout with the articles and sidebar sitting side-by-side. Add at least three more articles and then convert them to a grid, so that you show 3 articles per row in a box layout.\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Flexbox is relatively new and is not supported in older browsers. In most of your work, you'll use Flexbox. But an employer might want you to use one of the older layout strategies. Read this article to learn about positioning content in CSS using floats and absolute positioning.\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\n(Est. 1 hour) You may remember Bootstrap from your application process.

This is the first thing we'll do in JavaScript, using something called a console.log().\nconsole.log()\nWhen we ran the command node main.js - that did log to the console printing the words Hello World to the terminal. \nLet's open the file main.js and investigate its contents\n\nExercises\n\nWhat do you notice about the code? Anything you don't understand? Notice the semicolon, the dot, the parantheses - these are all elements of JavaScript Syntax\n\nTry to console.log() something different, for example, Hello World. I just started learning JavaScript!. (run node main.js after each change and look at the output in the console)\n\nTry to console.log() several things at once.\nWhat happens when you get rid of the quote marks?\nWhat happens when you console.log() just a number without quotes?\n\n\nComments\nYou can put comments to help you and others understand your code - use // to add a comment (or if it is a multi-line comment, then use /* and */ around your comment)\n// This is a comment for myself and other developers to understand the next line of code\nconsole.log('Hello world!');\n\nconsole.log('Hello World'); // comments can also be in the same line like this\n/*\nI can also make comments\nover more than one line if necessary\n*/\nconsole.log('Hello World');\n\n\nExercises What are the comments in that main.js script.\n\nNode?\nWe ran our JavaScript using Node -  Node is is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. Wikipedia\n\nExercises What are other \"places\" where we can run JavaScript code?\n\nData Types\nIf you played around with console.log() in the last step, you might have noticed that words always have to be inside quotes or else the code breaks, whereas numbers can work without quotes. Why is this? Well these are different data types in JavaScript. You'll need to learn the three main data types to get started coding (later we'll look at some other data types, like objects and arrays).\nStrings\nStrings are simple text, ranging anywhere from a single character to lengthy paragraphs. A string is always written inside a pair of quotes (single or double).\n'node girls'\n\nNumbers\nNumbers do not need to be wrapped in quotes like strings, and can just be written as is.\n100 // an integer number\n100.89 // a decimal number (floating point)\n\nBooleans\nThere is a special data type in JavaScript known as a \"boolean\" value. A boolean is either true or false, and it should be written without quotes.\ntrue\n\nYou've seen what they look like, now make sure they are what you think they are. There is a built-in feature in JavaScript which allows you to check the type of a particular value: typeof.\nWrite this code in your main.js, and run it (using node main.js in the terminal):\nconsole.log(typeof 'Hello world!');\n\nYou should see string printed to the console.\n\nExercise Now try that three times, once for each data type. Log the typeof for three different values: \"Code Your Future\", 6 and false. You should get different output for each one.\n\nVariables\nWhen you code, you'll want to create shortcuts so you can easily refer to things without writing out the same value every time. In JavaScript we have variables, which allow us to store values to use later.\n\nThink of variables names like labels on boxes, while the value of the variable are the contents of the box - you could change the contents of a box and leave the label intact, the contents of the boxes can have different types, the boxes should have good labels (a box of books being labeled pens would be very confusing),\n\nPhoto from Khan Academy\n\nTry it out\nYou create a variable using the keyword var, which lets the application know that you're about to store a value. You also have to give a name to your variable, which can be anything you like, so long as it doesn't include spaces.\nHere's an example of creating a variable called \"city\", which is storing a string called \"Glasgow\".\nvar city = 'Glasgow';\n\nconsole.log(city);\n\nYou'll notice that once you've created the variable, you can then simply write the name of the variable wherever you want to refer to it, rather than writing out Glasgow every time. You don't put quotes around a variable name.\nTry to run the above code, and see what is printed to the console.\n\nExercise\nIn the above example, what will happen if we change the second line to console.log(\"city\") - Do you notice the difference? What do you think will be the output?\n\nYou should have some code left over from previous steps which looks something like this (maybe even with comments):\nconsole.log(typeof 'Code Your Future');\nconsole.log(typeof 6);\nconsole.log(typeof false);\n\n\nExercise: Now that you know how to create variables, rewrite this code. This time, define these values as variables at the top of the file, create a variable called courseName and assign it the value Code Your Future. Then create a variable called courseDuration and assign it the value 6, and a variable called isHard and assign it the value false.\nRefer to the three variables that you just created to get their types (i.e. console.log(typeof courseName) etc...)\nIs your output the same?\n\nIf/Else Statements\nNow we're going to start adding in some logic. So far we have been logging the same thing every time we run the code, but what if we want to log according to different conditions? In programming there is something called an \"if/else statement\". It tests conditions, and will perform different actions based on the outcome of these tests.\nThe structure of an if/else statement in JavaScript is as follows:\nif (condition) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nIt basically translates to \"if this condition is true, do this - or else do something else\".\nTry it out\nWhat if we want to console.log() \"Hello world!\" if we're feeling happy, and something else if we're sad?\nLet's define a variable called isHappy, and assign it a boolean value of true or false (depending on how happy you're feeling).\nvar isHappy = true;\n\nThen let's write our if/else statement. In our condition, we want to test if the variable isHappy is equal to true. Note that in JavaScript, to test if two things are equal you need to use a triple equals (===) rather than just one (=).\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nNow let's add in what will happen if the conditions are met. The comments are there to explain what is happening.\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // if I am happy, print \"Hello world!\"\n  console.log('Hello world!');\n} else {\n  // if I am sad, print a frowny face\n  console.log(':(');\n}\n\nNow run this code and see what happens! Try changing the value of your variable from true to false.\n\nExercise\nWrite an if/else statement that evaluates if a number is even or odd. If it is even, it will print the string 'even', and if it is odd, it will print 'odd'.\nFor this challenge, you might find it useful to use the \"modulo\" operator, which looks like this: %. The modulo operator finds the remainder after division of one number by another. For example:\n13 % 2 === 1 // 13 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1\n100 % 10 === 0 // 100 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 0\n\nExercise\nNow improve your code so that it prints out if the number is positive or negative, as well as even or odd. For example, for -5 it will print 'negative odd', while for 4 it will print 'positive even'. \nHint: You can use the > or  signs.\nIf you finish early, think about how you would test your code works correctly?\n\nFor Loops\nCoding is great because it makes it easy to automate boring tasks, like writing the same thing over and over again. A \"for loop\" lets you do that in JavaScript. \"For loops\" let you perform the same operation a certain number of times, each time with a different value.\nA for loop has the following syntax:\nfor (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nStatement 1 defines a variable for the loop and assigns it a starting value. It is usually a number, which will increase each time the loop completes an iteration. We can use this number inside the loop to keep track of where we're at. You can set the number to be whatever you want initially.\nvar i=0\n\nStatement 2 defines how long the loop will go on for (what needs to happen for the loop to stop running?). It most often uses the less than () or less than or equal to () operators to set the length.\ni \nStatement 3 defines by how much to increment the i variable each time the loop completes an iteration. If you just want it to increase by one, then put i++, or else you can increase by other numbers like so:\ni+=2\n\nInside the square brackets goes the code you wish to be executed each time the loop runs. You can refer to the variable i from inside the loop.\nTry it out\nHere's an example of an actual for loop that prints out the numbers 1 to 10:\nfor (var i=1; i \nNotice the variable i is set to 1, because we want counting to begin there. The length is set to be less than or equal to 10, as we want the loop to end there. And we are increasing the value of i by one each time.\n\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that loops over the numbers from 1 to 100, printing only every second number. So it should return 2, 4, 6, 8, 10....\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that prints out all the numbers between 1 and 100 divisble by 5. \nSee if you can think or more than one way to solve this.\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that prints out the sum of all the numbers between 1 and 100.\n\nFunctions\nWe've been writing code that performs different actions, but sometimes you want to group code together to achieve a particular end. This is where functions come in.\nA function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A function is executed when it is \"invoked\".\nThe syntax of a function looks like this:\nfunction functionName (parameters) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nYou can call a function whatever you want, just like a variable. You can also give a function different values every time you run it which are called \"parameters\".\nTo make the function run, we invoke it like so:\nfunctionName();\n\nTry it out\nLet's write a function that adds two numbers together. We'll call it add. We want to add together two different numbers every time, so let's define two parameters to represent this, x and y.\nfunction add (x, y) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nadd(2, 3);\n\nNotice I've invoked the function underneath, with the paremeters 2 and 3. Inside the function, try to console.log() your parameters and see what happens.\nNow, we want to add these two numbers together, but it isn't enough just to write x + y, since we haven't told the function to return anything. It's time for a return statement. The return statement specifies the value to output.\nfunction add (x, y) {\n  return x + y;\n}\n\nadd(2, 3);\n\nRun this code, and hopefully you get the right answer!\n\nExercise \nWrite a function called multiply that multiplies two numbers together. It should take two numbers as parameters and return the answer.\nExercise\nGo back and copy the code to your previous solution for printing the sum of numbers between 1 and 100. Put this code inside a function.\nChange the function so it accepts any two limits and prints the sum of all the numbers between those limits.\nFor example: addBetween(1,3) should print 6\n\nResources\n\nData Types\nComparison Operators\nArithmetic Operators\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo that you have forked during this class contains few challenges - solve them in JavaScript!\n\nFollow this course on Khan Academy.

Arrays are to the rescue!\nImagine an array like a list or a collection of variables, but instead of each variable having its own name, only the array has a name. So how do you access a variable inside, then? How do you read and write? Using an index!\nAn index is just a whole number, such as 0, 1, 2 and so forth. As in many areas of computing, indices in JavaScript arrays start with 0 --- so 0 is the index of the first element of an Array, 1 is the index of the second element, and so forth.\nThe syntax is to list the values separated by commas, inside square brackets:\n[value1, value2, value3]\n\nYou can store any type of value inside an array: strings, numbers, booleans. You can even store other arrays, or objects (which you will learn about next).\nTry it out\nDefining an array as a variable looks something like this:\nvar animals = [\"tiger\", \"puppy\", \"snake\", \"llama\"];\n\nPretty neat! Now you have all the animals grouped together rather than having to define them separately. You can see how many animals there are by using .length:\nconsole.log(animals.length);\n\nIf you want to refer to one specific member of the array, you can do so by using their \"index number\" like so.\nconsole.log(animals[1]);\n\n\nTake a guess at which animal that will print out, and see if you're right.\n\nSpoiler alert, it will print out \"puppy\". That might seem weird, until you learn that JavaScript is a \"0-index\" language. What that means is that counting in JavaScript starts at 0. So animals[0]will print out \"tiger\". We don't make the rules...\n\nExercise: \n\nCreate an array that contains the countries of all the students in the class (at least five nationalities)\nconsole.log the number of countries in the Array\nNow, console.log() each country in the list. Hint: For loops\n\nDon't ask a mentor - Google it! Try googling to find the answer if you're stuck. Google skills are an essential part of being a developer.\n\nObjects\nNow for the final data type: objects. Like arrays, they can store multiple bits of information, except objects store the properties of something. For example, you might want to save the name, model and colour of a car. Or the name, time and location of a film playing at the cinema.\nThe syntax looks like this:\n{\n  property1: \"value1\",\n  property2: \"value2\",\n  property3: \"value3\"\n}\n\nThe names on the left (\"property1\") are known \"keys\". Any values can be given to them: strings, booleans, integers.\nTry it out\nLet's define an object that represents a person:\nvar person = {\n  firstName: \"Nelson\",\n  lastName: \"Mandela\",\n  occupation: \"freedom fighter\",\n  age: 95,\n  alive: false\n};\n\nWe can console.log() the entire object, but you can also reference just one of the properties. Run this code:\nconsole.log(person.firstName);\n\n\nExercise\nUsing an object representing a person, console.log() a sentence introducing the person. Print out the following:\n\"Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName}. I am {age} years old, and work as a {occupation}.\"\nHint: you can construct longer strings by adding them together. This includes variables. For example:\nvar name = \"Jane\";\nconsole.log(\"People call me \" + name);\n\n// the previous line will print\n// \"People call me Jane\"\n\n\nUseful array methods\nConcatenating two arrays\nYou've learned how you can add two numbers and append two strings, but how does this work for arrays? A simple arr1 + arr2 will not do, but there is a method you can use: concat(). It is a method that you call on the array (similar to how console.log is the log function called on console) and takes the array you want to append as a parameter.\nvar countries = ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria'];\nvar moreCountries = ['Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France'];\n\ncountries.concat(moreCountries);\nconsole.log(countries); // ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria', 'Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France']\n\nAppending an element\nIf you want to append an element to an array, you can just put it after the last existing element like so:\ncountries[countries.length] = 'United States of America';\n\nThere is another way though, which is a bit more elegant: the push function.\ncountries.push('United States of America');\n\n// .push can also be called with multiple parameters\ncountries.push('United States of America', 'France');\n\n\nExercise: Search .slice, .splice and .pop and tell us what they do\n\nResources\n\nArrays\nObjects\nStrings\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo that you have forked during the last class contains few challenges - solve them all in JavaScript.

General data structure types include the array, the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on.\nWe have been dealing mainly with two types of data structures so far - Arrays and Objects.\nWhen we are you solving a problem, one of your main decisions as a developer is to choose the data structures you will use to solve it. So when do you use an Array and when do you use an Object.\n\n\"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\"\nLinus Torvalds\nLet's talk about the differences between Arrays and Objects - when can you use or the other. As a general rule of thumb:\n\n\nDoes the order of data matter? Then use Arrays.\nCan the data be organised by a label? Then use Objects.\n\n\nExercise: Let's say we're writing a program to model and display a Newspaper: what data structure would you use to model the different sections of the newspaper (sports, politics etc..)? Write a data structure in JavaScript to represent your newspaper\nExercise: Now if we're going to model a Book with different chapters - what data strucuture would we use?\nExercise: Think of a scenario where we might need to combine both?\n\nObject Exercises\n\nExercise\nWrite a function \"printProperties\" that takes an object and prints its properties\n\nvar student = {\n    name: \"Simon\",\n    age: \"21\",\n    interests : [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\n};\n\nprintProperties(student);\n// Output in this case should be name, age, interests\n\n\nExercise\nWrite a function called hasProperty that takes an object and a property. The function should return true if the property exists, false if it doesn't\n\nvar student = {\n    name: \"Simon\",\n    age: \"21\",\n    interests : [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\n};\n\nhasProperty(student, 'age'); // should return true\nhasProperty(student, 'job'); // should return false\n\n\nExercise: compare that to how you find an element in array?\nExercise\nWrite a function called ownProperty that takes an object which has a prototype, and a field. The function should return true only if the property exists on the object (and not it's prototype)\n```js\nvar person = {\n    name: \"Simon\"\n}\n\nvar student = {\n    interests: [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\n}\nstudent.proto = person // this is setting the prototype of student to be person\nownProperty(student, \"name\") // should return false\nownProperty(student, \"interests\") // should return true\n\n>Exercise\n>Write a function called printObject that takes an object and iterates through all its properties and prints a string formatted property: value\n>Bonus points if you can format the list of interests properly\n\n```js\nvar student = {\n    name: \"Simon\",\n    age: \"21\",\n    interests : [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\n};\n\nprintObject(student); //output: \"name is Simon, age is 21, interests are [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\n\nExercise\nWrite a function called \"printArray\" that use the previous function \"printObject\". It should loop through the array of students and print each item\n\nvar students = [{\n    name: \"Etza\",\n    age: \"21\",\n    interests : [\"javascript\", \"css\"]\n}, {\n    name: 'Mohamed',\n    age: 22,\n    interests: [\"javascript\", \"c#\"]\n}];\n\nprintArray(student);\n// output:\n// \"name is Simon, age is 21, interests are [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\"\n// \"name is Mohamed, age is 22, interests are [\"javascript\", \"c#\"]\"\n\nMore advanced working with objects\nLet's say you have the following object in javascript, where each key/property is the type of note (Â£5, Â£10 and Â£20 note), and the value is the number of notes in the wallet.\nvar wallet = {\n  5: 3,\n  10: 7,\n  20: 2\n}\n\n\nExercise\nWrite a function that takes in the wallet as an argument, and returns the total money in the wallet.\n\nNext you're given another wallet, and it's put in an array with the first:\nvar walletA = { // our original wallet\n  5: 3,\n  10: 7,\n  20: 2\n}\n\nvar walletB = {\n  5: 6,\n  10: 0,\n  20: 1\n}\n\nvar wallets = [walletA, walletB]\n\n\nExercises\n\nWrite a function - sumWallets - that takes the array wallets and returns the total amount of money for all of the wallets.\n\nWrite another function - combineWallets - that takes the array of wallets and combines all of the notes in each of them, returning a single wallet with all of the other wallets' notes.\n\nSee if you can write a function - sumDynamicWallet - that will sum up and return the total amount in a single wallet, but it could have any number of different notes inside it (Â£7 note or a Â£13 or any other number).\n\nSee if you can write a function that takes in any number of wallets, which could contain any denomination/type of notes inside them (each being different). Tip: have a think about if you could re-use a function from a previous example...\n\n\n\nValue vs Reference Types\nA variable can hold two types of values: primitives (value types) and reference types.\nThe distinction between them is very important and will be a fundamental addition\nto your JavaScript arsenal.\nPrimitives are:\n\nstring (example: John Doe)\nnumber (example: 100)\nboolean (example: true or false)\n\nReference types are:\n\nObjects (example: {greeting: \"hello\"})\nArrays (example: [1,2,3])\nFunctions (example: function doNothing() { })\n\nVariables can only hold a few bytes of data. \nBecause primitives have fixed sizes, when you assign a primitive to a variable, \nit will hold the actual value of the primitive (hence the name \"value type\").\nBut reference types can have practically infinite sizes, so when you assign a reference type \nto a variable, that variable will hold a reference to it only: an identifier which will tell our program\nwhere to look for that object in memory.\n\nPass by value / reference\nConsider the example below.\n``js\nfunction addFive(value) {\n    value = value + 5;\n}\nvar ten = 10;\naddFive(ten);\nconsole.log(ten);\n\nWe have a function that accepts a value as an argument. The function then adds five to the\nargument and logs the value.\nAfter invoking the function with the variable `ten`, the variable is logged.\n\nWhat will be the values logged?\nAnswer: 10 (not 15)\n\nExplanation:\nIn JavaScript, variables are always passed to function by value. That means only the value\nthe variables was holding is passed to the function, and not a reference to the variable's\nlocation in memory. That means that inside a function call, any changes we make to its\narguments will only apply inside the function (as seen in the previous example).\n\n**Be careful though**, as the value of an argument might be a reference to a JavaScript\nobject, in which case, changing a property on that object will also reflect everywhere\nelse we use a reference to that object.\n\nFor example:\n\n``js\n\nfunction a(primitive, object) {\n    primitive = primitive + 5;\n    object.greeting = \"how are you?\";\n    object = {\n      greeting: \"holla!\"  \n    };\n}\nvar primitive = 10;\nvar object = {\n  greeting: 'hello'  \n};\na(primitive, object);\nconsole.log(primitive); // 10\nconsole.log(object.greeting); // \"how are you?\"\n\nLet's look at the illustrations here: http://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-primitive-vs-reference-values/ to understand this behavior better\nExercise\n\nOpen up the CodePen here\nCreate a new index.html and main.js file\nLink the main.js from the index.html so that it runs in the browser\nCopy the exercises from the CodePen above into main.js and follow the instructions in the comments\n\n\nScope\nBefore we get into what scope is, let's try a little exercise.\nOpen up jsbin and write the following:\nfunction () {\n    var name = \"hello\";\n}\nconsole.log(name);\n\n\nWhat do you think the first console.log will print?\n\nvar hello = \"outer\";\nfunction() {\n    var hello = \"inner\";\n    console.log(hello);\n}\n\n\nWhat do you think calling the function will print?\n\nLet's see another example\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n    var a = 10;\n\n    var secondFunction = function() {\n        console.log(a);\n    }\n\n    secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nThis should work fine, and the console should print 10. But what if we swap the positions of var a and the console.log()?\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n    console.log(a);\n\n    var secondFunction = function() {\n        var a = 10;\n    }\n\n    secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nThis returns an error: ReferenceError: a is not defined. You might think that the problem is that we're trying to console log a before it's declared in the code order. So let's try putting the console.log(a) after secondFunction, where a is assigned:\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n\nvar secondFunction = function() {\n    var a = 10;\n}\n\nconsole.log(a);\n\nsecondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nWait, we're still getting the ReferenceError! Even if we move the console.log(a) underneath where secondFunction is called, we still get the error. What's going on?\nWhat we're seeing here is the effect of scope. Take a look at the following diagram:\n\nWe can see from this picture that each function is like a 'bubble', and it has access to the variable assigned within it, and the variables assigned 'above' it, in it's surrounding function. But note that the 'global' scope doesn't have access to var o, and function outer() doesn't have access to var i. So each function can access the variables in its parent scope, and in it's own, immediate scope, but it cannot see the variables in its child scope.\nIf a variable is declared outside of a function, in the 'window', it has 'global' scope. The scope within a function is 'local' scope:\nvar test = \"I'm global\";\n\nfunction testScope() {\n    var test = \"I'm local\";\n    console.log (test);     \n}\n\ntestScope();           // output: I'm local\n\nconsole.log(test);     // output: I'm global\n\n\nExercise\n\nContinue working on your main.js from your previous exercises\nCopy the exercises from this CodePen\nRemember to comment/uncomment each set once you're done with them\n\n\nResources\n\nObjects vs Arrays - https://www.metaltoad.com/blog/javascript-understanding-objects-vs-arrays-and-when-use-them-part-1\nJavaScript Arrays and Objects Are Just Like Books and Newspapers https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-arrays-and-objects-are-just-like-books-and-newspapers-6e1cbd8a1746\n\nHomework\n\nCreate an account on CodeWars and do at least 15 challenges.\nSign up for the JavaScript 30 course and do at least 2 project.

But JavaScript was not meant to be run in console.log: it was meant to make web pages pages dynamic.\nLots of websites are powered by JavaScript today, and some (like Facebook) cannot function at all without it: it's become that important to the look and feel of the website.\nThe DOM\nYour webpages are made up of a bunch of HTML elements, nested within each other (parents and children). But JavaScript doesn't know about any of that.\nThankfully, in JavaScript we have access to this \"DOM\" object (Document Object Model) which is actually a representation of our webpage that JavaScript can work with.\nHere are two examples, HTML and then JavaScript, of how the DOM might look like:\n\n    \n         Welcome! \n         Hello world! \n    \n\n\n``js\nvar document = {\n    body: {\n        h1: \"Welcome\",\n        p: \"Hello world!\"\n    }\n};\n\nThe DOM offers a lot of useful functions we can use to find elements on the page. Here are some we'll be using today:\n\n``js\n    document.querySelector('#mainHeader');\n    document.querySelectorAll('p');\nBoth .querySelector and querySelectorAll accept a CSS selector as an input.\n.querySelector selects only the first element it finds, querySelectorAll selects all elements (it returns an array).\nOnce you retrieve an element using .querySelector, you can attach an event to it. An event is any action that can be performed on that element. For now, we will just use the click event:\n``js\n    var myButton = document.querySelector('#myButton');\n    myButton.addEventListener(\"click\", alertSomething);\nfunction alertSomething() {\n    alert(\"Something\");\n}\n\nYou will notice in the example example that we passed a second argument to `addEventListener`. That second argument is the **function** that we want to invoke when that event has happened.\n\n> **Exercise**:\n> - Fork the repo [here](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/dom-ajax) and clone it locally.\n> - Open `index.html` in your browser.\n> - In `./js/main.js` write code so that when a user presses the **Donate a bike today** button, an **alert** pops up, thanking them for their donation.\n\nThe elements returned by `document.querySelector` have the same properties as a normal HTML element: for example, you can get access to their css **styles**.\n\n``js\n    var myElement = document.querySelector('#myElement');\n    myElement.style.backgroundColor = 'red';\n\nExercise:\nChange your code, so that instead of alerting something when you press the button, it changes the background color of the Jumbotron to red.\n\nUsing the document, you can also create new elements. These elements will not appear until you append them as a child of another element though:\n``js\n    var paragraph = document.createElement('p'); // here we're just creating it, element is not visible yet\n    myElement.appendChild(paragraph); // now the element is added to our view, but it's empty\n\n`document.createElement` accepts as an input any element type. So for example `document.createElement('article')` will create a new article element.\n\nYou can then change the text displayed inside elements using the `innerText` property:\n\n``js\n    paragraph.innerText = \"How are you?\"; // now we can see the text displaying on the screen\n\nExercise:\nWhen Add to learn more button is clicked it should:\n\ncreate a new paragraph element\nset its inner text property to some message you want\nadd the paragraph to the #mainArticles element just below Learn more\n\n\nWe've been using document.querySelector to retrieve a single element.\nTo retrieve an array of multiple elements (that match a specific class name for example, or a specific tag) we use document.querySelectorAll.\n``js\n    //change the background of all the paragraph items on our page\n    var paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p');\n    for(var i=0; i\n\nWe've learned that `style` and `innerText` are properties of DOM elements. Image tags can also have `width` and `height`.\n\n> **Exercise**:\n> Every time the **All images** button is clicked it should reduce and width and height of all images on the webpage by `10`.\n\nWhile it's really easy to change styles directly on elements using the `style` property, it is not usually a good idea to mix JavaScript and CSS (see separation of concerns in the first lesson). To solve this, we can use the `className` property to set the class for an element instead of changing its styles directly:\n\n``js\n//before: \nvar container = document.querySelector('#myContainer');\ncontainer.className = \"largeBlock\";\n//after: \n\nExercise:\nRemember the button that changes the color of the jumbotron to red? Go back and try to do that without modifying the styles. You can use the .red class.\nAdvanced Exercise:\n\nWhen you type something into the box below the Jumbotron and click the Add button it should add a new Article below Learn More with what you typed as the inner text. It should then clear the input.\nMake sure you create a proper article that looks like the others above it (it should be an article element, that contains a paragraph element, that contains your text, it should also have the class article).\n\n\nTopic 1\nHigh level explanation of Topic 1 - rely on the exercises\n\nExercise: Always have exercises\n\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nResources\n\nResource 1 to learn more about Topic 1\nResource 2 for Topic 2\n\nHomework\n\nFirst part of Homework - Easy\n\nSecond part of Homework - Intermediate/Hard\n\n[Bonus/Optional] Third part/optional - Hardest\n\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nRead this Some Tutorial or Video etc...\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html","title":"Week 8 - More DOM and AJAX","keywords":"","body":"\nJS in the Browser\n What we will learn today?\n\nJS in the Browser\nDOM\nAJAX\n\n\nAJAX\nWhat's a server?\nA device or program that provides functionality to other programs or devices. There are database servers, mail servers, game servers, etc.\nThey can take the form of industrial server farms that provide a service to millions of users (used by Facebook, Google, etc.), to personal servers for storing your files.\nThe server communicates with clients. Clients can be a web browser, a Slack app, your phone, etc.\nClientâ€“server systems use the requestâ€“response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgement.\n\nAn example: We can use the Slack app (the client) to put our messages or pictures on Slack. The content is stored on the Slack servers and other clients can then also access the pictures.\n\nHTTP requests\nA server stores the data, and the client (other programs or computers) requests data or sends some of its own. But how do they talk to each other?\nFor the client and the server to communicate they need an established language (a protocol). Which is what HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is for. It defines the methods you can use to communicate with a server and indicate your desired actions on the resources of the server.\nThere are two main types of requests: GET and POST.\n\nWith a GET request you can ask for specified resource (e.g. show me that Slack photo).\nWith a POST request you can send content to the server to be appended to the web resource (e.g. post a photo on Slack).\n\nHTTP is the language of the internet. In our case we're using Javascript, but you can send HTTP requests with other laguages as well.\nAJAX (= Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)\nAJAX is a set of useful methods for implementing client-server communication.\n\nAJAX just uses a combination of:\n\n\nA browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)\nJavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)\n\n\nAjax works behind the scenes, helping the webpage communicate with the server (with GET and POST requests).\n\nclient ----------GET request----------> server returns data to client\nclient ----------POST request (with content)--------->server updates data with content\n\nThe server holds the data, but it only sends it to the webpage when there's a request. The request can be sent after the page has loaded, for example when a user clicks a button.\nWhy Ajax?\nThere are other ways you can write HTTP requests, such as using Web sockets.

It makes programs easier to read and to understand. It allows for us to more easily modify and extend code. It saves space and improves performance.\nAt the most basic level, a function is a series of instructions that can take an input and produce an output. Parameters dictate how the function behaves.\n \nWe've used functions a bit, but now we need to know how to use them well.\nThere are many ways to write code that does the same thing. But are they all equal?\n\nExercise: Let's look at a really obvious example of a function with redundant code. What could we do to improve it?\n\n``js\nfunction printHelloFiveTimes(){\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n}\n\nIntroducing a simple for loop makes our lives a lot easier. This way we can more easily see what the function does and make modifications.\n\n``js\nfunction printHelloFiveTimes(){\n  for ( var i = 0; i \nExercise: Now, let's look at a different example. Let's say we wanted to welcome mentors:\n\n``js\nfunction welcomeMentors(){\n  console.log(\"Hello Mozafar\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Rares\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Tim\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Ashleigh\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Gordon\");\n}\n\nWe could be lazy and change how we welcome the mentors.\n\n``js\nfunction welcomeMentors(){\n  var mentorNames = \"Mozafar, Rares, Tim, Ashleigh, Gordon\";\n  console.log(\"Hello \" + mentorNames);\n}\nBut it's not quite the output we wanted. And we can be smarter about it. Why not a loop?\n``js\nfunction welcomeMentors(){\n  var mentorNames = [\"Mozafar\", \"Rares\", \"Tim\", \"Ashleigh\", \"Gordon\"];\n  for ( var i = 0; i \n\nSo functions help us to organise and enhance our code. But what makes good design? Is it just \"shorter is always better\"?\n\n## Good Design\n\nDesign is important if we want our code to be understandable (both to other humans, but also to us in the future), to be easy to use and easy to expand.\n\nThere are three main principles you need to know now: clarity, reusability and extensibility. There are also others, but they are deeply related to these three.\n\nTo\n\n- Ease of Maintenance / Clarity\n    - Naming\n    - Formatting\n    - Commenting\n    - Clear logic\n    - Concise\n    - Avoiding Redundancy\n\n- Reusability\n    - DRY\n    - Single Reponsibility\n        - Avoiding global state (scope)\n        - Predictability and Ease of testing\n\n- Extensibility\n    - Avoiding being unnecessarily specific (e.g. magic numbers)\n\n> Exercise: Find all the design issues with this function.\n\nAs an aside: if you try to run the code it won't work, but not because it's not correct. It's only because it is a fragment of a larger program and lacks some code such as the function updateCorpDatabase(), the initialisation of the global variables referenced (e.g. quarter, profit) and, of course, the HandlesStuff() function also hasn't been called.\n\n``js\nfunction HandlesStuff(inputRecord, savedrecord, income1, income2, expenseType, revenue, expense0, expense1, expense2, screenx, screeny, success){\n\n  var i;\n  for ( i = 0; i What is wrong with this function?\n\nNaming: the function has a bad name, HandleStuff() tells you nothing about what the function does. It's also considered bad practice to name variables vaguely by separating them through numbers (debt1, expense1, etc). If you find yourself doing this then you should either use an array (such as expenses[]) or use a more specific name for each variable (such as pastIncome and currentIncome). There is also inconsistency in the use of camel casing (inputRecord versus savedrecord).\n\nCommenting: the function isn't documented at all. It's very difficult to understand what the function's purpose is and how each part of the code contributes to it. By writing comments, the coder communicates their reasoning and helps the function be human readable.\n\nLayout/ Formatting: the physical organisation of the code on the page gives few hints about its logical organisation. Layout strategies are used inconsistently throughout the code: incorrect indentation, unnecessary spacing (between the two else ifs) and the long list of parameters is unreadable. This makes the code look messy and confusing.\n\nInput variables: the function's input variable, inputRecord, is set (hardcoded) within the function. If it's an input variable, its value should not be modified. If the value of the variable is supposed to be modified, then the variable should not be called inputRecord.\n\nGlobal variables: the function reads and writes global variables - it reads from quarter and writes to profit. It should communicate with other functions more directly, rather than by reading and writing global variables.\n\nSingle Responsibility: the function does not have a single purpose. It initialises some variables, writes to a database, does some calculations - none of which seem to be related to each other in any way. A function should have a single, clearly defined purpose. This function looks like it needs restructuring: breaking it into multiple functions.\n\nData checks: the function doesn't defend itself against bad data. If quarter equals 0, the expression income2 * 4.0 / quarter causes a divide-by-zero error.\n\nMagic numbers: the function uses several magic numbers: 100, 4.0, 1, 2 and 3. These are numbers that are used directly in an expression rather than saving them first in a variable. This is discouraged as it makes it more difficult to manipulate the values. If we were to save them in a variable they would be easier to find and modify.\n\n\n``js\ntenSquared =  1010\ntenCubed = 1010*10\nx = 10\nxSquared =  xx\nxCubed = xx*x\n\n9. Useless parameters: some of the function's parameters are never used (screenx, screeny and success). They should be removed because they are confusing. It is tempting when you're starting to code a function to add more parameters thinking that you might need them, but it's important to remove them if you don't end up using them.\n\n10. DRY principle: the function breaks the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule. The expression profit = revenue - expense0 is written 3 times unnecessarily, the only difference being whether it's the first, second or third expense. This variable can be restructured into an array.\n\n``js\nvar expense = [expense1,expense2,expense3];\nprofit = revenue - expense[expenseType];\n\nExercise: We have the following problem to solve, write really bad code that gives the right result. Tell us why it is bad.\n\nWrite a function that will print out the number of vowels that are in mentors' names.\n\nExercise: Now, let's write it well together.\n\nResources\n\nJavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford, chapter 4 - Functions\nMDN Objects basics\nMDN OOP in JS\n\n"},"js-core-3/week-10/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-3/week-10/lesson.html","title":"Week 10 - TDD","keywords":"","body":"\nTDD\n What we will learn today?\n\nUnit Testing\nThe Jest testing framework\nThe test() function\nexpect() and toBe()\nnpm test\nTest coverage\n\n\nTest-driven development (TDD)\nRed, green, refactoring\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get started\n\nFork this repository to your own Github account, then clone it to your computer.Today's exercises will be based on this repository.\n\nUnit Testing\nTesting is a key skill for any software programmer. We need to make sure our software is thoroughly tested, otherwise bad things happen. Testing makes sure our programs behave like we intend them to do - if we don't test, we can cause severe bugs. Bad software can make planes crash, companies bankrupt, and users of your software really frustrated.\nThere are different levels on which we can test software, for example integration testing, end-to-end testing, and unit testing. Today we will deal with unit testing, which is probably the most universal testing discipline.\nA unit test is exactly that - it tests a unit of code. \"Unit\" can mean different things, but in JavaScript it usually refers to a single function.\nRemember when we talked about functions? Functions take input (as arguments), do something with it (in the function body), and return output (using the return statement). Ideally, a function should always return the same output if the same input is given. It makes it predictable and testable - and that's what we want!\n         |-----------------|\ninput => | doing something | => output\n         |-----------------|\nSo, when unit testing a function, we want to make sure that for a certain input, we get the expected output. For this we need to make sure that the output matches our expectations. In the simplest form that means we do an equality check:\nmyFunction(input) === expectedOutput\n\nWe can formalise this using another function that compares two values and complains when they do not match. Such a function is prepared in unit-testing/equals.js.\nWe can use this function to simply compare to values:\nequals(1, 1); // This should pass\nequals(1, 2); // This should fail\nequals(\"Hello\", \"Hello\"); // This should pass\n\nNow we can use this equals() function to test our own code by comparing a function result to an expected value.\n\nTogether: Follow the instructions in unit-testing/sum.js!\nExercise: Now you! Take the provided unit-testing/findNeedle.js and turn it into a function that returns a result instead of\nprinting it. Then run it using multiple inputs and make sure it returns the correct results each time!\n\nTest-driven development (TDD)\n\nTest-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. (Wikipedia)\n\nA key principle in TDD is that we write think about our requirements before we dive into code: What should our program be able to do? What are our edge cases?\nWe formalise those requirements by writing tests - even before our program is written! At this time, all our tests will fail, because we haven't written any code yet. Our tests are now RED (the colour represents a failing test).\nNow we want to turn this RED into GREEN. We do this by implementing our function in a way that covers all our test cases.\n\nExercise: Follow the instructions in tdd/findNeedle.js!\n\nRefactoring\nThere are times when we want to make our code better without changing any functionality, for example because we just learnt about a better way to solve a certain problem (like, finding needles in haystacks). This is called refactoring.\nWhen previously GREEN code - working code! - suddenly does not work anymore, we call this a regression. Our existing tests can make sure that when we refactor, the functionality of our code actually stays the same, and does not regress.\n\nTogether: Refactor the findNeedle function we just wrote to be implemented using .map() and .filter().\n\nUnit testing frameworks\nThere are lots of other things you might want to test for than two things being equal. You might want to test if a number is smaller or greater than another, if a function was called, if an error happened, or if one thing happened before another thing, or how long a function call took to execute.\nWe don't have to build all these things ourselves. Instead there are unit testing frameworks that take all that work off our shoulders. All we need to do is provide the code and the tests.\nJest\nThe unit testing framework we are trying to day is called Jest. It's created by Facebook and useful for all kinds of unit testing (especially testing React, which we will do in a later lesson).\nLook into your jest/ folder. You will find a file there, sum.test.js. The suffix .test.js tells Jest that this file contains tests it should execute. To execute the test, run the following command in your terminal:\nnpm test\n\nThis command runs the test in sum.test.js, which tests the sum() function. You can see the test output and the fact that the test passed.\nTests cases in Jest have the following structure:\ntest('test description', function() {\n  // Test instructions\n});\n\nJest provides a set of functions that you can use to write your actual tests. They are created in a way that imitates natural language, for example:\n_Expect_ sum of 1 and 2 _to be_ 3\nbecomes\nexpect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);\n\nYou can add multiple test statements in the same test case (a test case is one call of the test function, but you can also create multiple test cases in one file. It is important that you give all your test cases meaningful descriptions.\n\nExercise: Add another test case to sum.test.js. Is the sum of 10 and -10 really zero? Run the tests using Jest.\nExercise: Take the findNeedle function you have tested previously, copy it into the jest/ folder and call it findNeedle.test.js. Then write a test to be used with Jest, similar to sum.test.js. Make sure you cover multiple inputs and give all tests meaningful descriptions! Run the tests using Jest.\n\nTest coverage\nTest coverage describes the extent to which a code base is tested. When Jest runs your tests, it generates a so-called coverage report. This report tells you how many of your lines of code are covered by tests, how many functions, statements, and branches.\n\nA branch is one of multiple ways a code control flow can go. For example, if you have an if() ... else ..., both the \"if\" and the \"else\" branch must be covered by tests.\n\nWe want to keep our code coverage as high as possible. Jest allows us to generate a coverage report when we run the following command in the terminal:\nnpm test -- --coverage\n\n\nExercise: Check your code coverage for the tests you wrote. Is any of the numbers below 100%? If so, try and bring it up to 100%!\n\nResources\n\nTest-driven development\nJest\nModules\n\nHomework\n\nRead the Wikipedia article about Test-driven development\nSolve the exercises in this repo (using TDD) https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-tdd-exercises\n\nTODO\nResearch\n\nResearch other module formats than CommonJS.

Let's try it.\n\n## Arrow functions\n> Exercise: ES6 also has a new way of declaring functions. Let's see how it works.\n\n> Exercise: Refactor the previous code to have a separate function that checks if gender is 'female' or not, and use it in sayGreeting. Let's try and make the code as compact as possible together using ES6 features.\n\n## More ES6\nThere are so many features in ES6. They're mostly what we call `syntax sugar`. They don't provide new functionality, but new (more elegant) ways of accomplishing the same tasks.\n\nSince not all ES6 features are supported in all browsers, many developers and projects use what is called `Transpilation` - a process that transpiles/translates ES6 code to ES5 syntax that is supported by all browsers.\n\nOn Node, most ES6 features are now natively supported in Node 8.\n\n> From now on, we expect you to use ES6 syntax in your assignments and the code you write.\n\n# TDD again\n\n> Exercise: Clone the repo https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-core-2-exercises\n\n> Let's talk about TDD again?\n> 1. Why do we do TDD\n> 2. How do we run the tests? Read some of the tests\n> 3. Notice we're separating our tests from our code now. We are making use of **modules**\n> 4. Also notice the **coverage**\n\n## How do modules work?\n\nSo far, all our programs have been in their own single files. But Node programs can become really large, and having all our code in only one file will not be maintainable.\n\nWe can therefore split our code into so-called *modules*. A module is basically a JavaScript file that makes its functionality available to other modules and programs.\n\n## Creating modules, exporting code\n\nIt is really simple to take existing JavaScript code and turn it into a module by exporting its functionality:\n\n```js\nfunction printName(name) {\n  console.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = printName;\nThe key here is the line containing module.exports. As you see, this is an assignment, and whatever is assigned to module.exports will be made available to other modules and program when this file is imported.\nUsing modules, importing code\nBut how do we make use of another module in our program? We need to import it, and this is done using a function called require().\n\nThere are different module formats for JavaScript. The one we are using here, which is natively supported by Node, is called CommonJS.\n\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\n\nThe string passed to the require() function is a path to the file you are importing. ./ signifies the current directory, so the above command will import a file called \"printName.js\" that is in the same directory as our program.\n\nAssuming our program is in the same folder as printName.js, we can use the above code to import the functionality provided by that module and store it in the printName variable.\nWe can then continue to use the printName function as if it we defined it in our own program!\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\nprintName();\n\nModules can not only export functions, but all variable types you already learned about. Most commonly, they export a function or an object containing multiple functions.\nTogether: Edit the file modules/main.js and follow the instructions.\n\nSeparating code and tests\nExporting and importing modules is really useful for testing, too.\nAs a rule of thumb, we never want to mix our actual code with our tests. It is therefore common to put them in separate files. We are going to call the file containing the tests after the file containing the code to be tested, just appending .test at the end of the filename. Like so:\nmain.js               # Our main program\nmain.test.js          # Tests for our main program\nsomeOtherCode.js      # A module called \"someOtherCode\"\nsomeOtherCode.test.js # Tests for the \"someOtherCode\" module\n\nThe naming is really up to convention - you can even put your tests in a different folder! However, for Jest it is important to call test files \"*.test.js\".\n\nResources\n\nES6 features\nLet and const\n\nHomework\n\nWatch Wes Bos videos about ES6 - https://es6.io/ (if you don't have access, let us know)\n\nFork, Clone and Do the exercises in this repo - https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-core-2-exercises\n\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nFinish this tutorial about Chrome Dev Tools(https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/)\n\n"},"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html","title":"Week 12 - Exam?

Its job is to send and receive data.\nLet's take a website for example.  A website is just a collection of HTML and CSS files, images, maybe some javascript files.

If you want to share your project with others, you need to have a list of the things you installed, so that other people know what to install in order to run the project.\nIn Node.js, this 'list' file is called a package.json. The 'things you've installed' are referred to as dependencies. Creating this file is the first step in setting up your Node.js project. \n1. Make a package.json file\nLet's start by creating the package.json file. We can add things to it as the project grows. The package.json file is easy to create from the command line. Type the following command into your terminal to get started:\n$ npm init\nThis command will initialise a step-by-step process for creating the package.json. You should see something like this:\n\nIt will ask you a bunch of questions.\n\nYou can skip most of the questions but change the entry point from (index.js) to server.js.\nThe wizard asks you for the following information: name, version, description, main, test, repository, keywords, author, license - do you understand all of them?\n\nAt the endo of the wizard, you should see a new file called package.json in your project's folder.\nHere is an example package.json file for a project called Passport.\nWhat is JSON?\nJSON is a type of file for structuring data in a readable way. It is also a really popular format for sending data across the web.\nJSON is a string representation of a Javascript object. JSON objects convert really easily to Javascript objects, and vice versa, with JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify().\n``js\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"isAlive\": true,\n  \"age\": 25,\n  \"address\": {\n    \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",\n    \"city\": \"New York\",\n    \"state\": \"NY\",\n    \"postalCode\": \"10021-3100\"\n  },\n  \"phoneNumbers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"home\",\n      \"number\": \"212 555-1234\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"office\",\n      \"number\": \"646 555-4567\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"mobile\",\n      \"number\": \"123 456-7890\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"children\": [],\n  \"spouse\": null\n}\n\n# Step 2 - Installing Express\n\nBefore we write any code, you'll need to install the Express library. We're going to use the **[Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/)** to download it using the **`npm install`** command.\n\nNPM is the place to go to download other Node code written by other people.  There are thousands of open-source, 3rd-party Node modules (also known as \"packages\") by other people that you can download and use in your own projects. \n\nAs we install Express, we'll need to update the `package.json` to add Express as a dependency. We do this so that other people working on the project will know to install Express before running any of the code. This can be done by adding **`--save`** to the end of your command.\n\nRun the following command in your terminal:\n\n`$ npm install express --save`\n\nExpress should now be installed. Check your `package.json` file to make sure it has been added as a dependency. It will look like this:\n\n![package.json screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10683087/16382664/be35f0b4-3c79-11e6-82b6-ae9e4a037c3f.png)\n\n# Step 3 - Building the server\n\nThe first thing we need to do is build our server. You will always need to build a server when writing back-end code. A server can be built in pure Node.js, but Express gives us simpler syntax to work with.\n\n\n## 1. Create a `server.js` file\n\nLet's build our server! Before we do anything, let's create a new file called `server.js`. This is where all our server code is going to live.\n\n## 2. `require` the `express` library\n\nWe already installed Express in Step 2, but we need to make sure it is included in this file specifically so we can make use of its methods. In Node.js, when you want to access the functionality of a library or module in another file, you `require` it.\n\nTo import Express, write the following inside `server.js`:\n\n```js\nconst express = require('express');\n\nWe will try and get used to ES6 syntax - so use const and let instead of var.\n\n3. Initialise the server\nTo initialise our server, we just need to call the express() function. This will create an Express application for us to work with.\nAdd the second line of code to your server.js file:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\n4. Start 'listening' for potential requests\nOne more step left, we need to set a port for our server to listen to. Think of a port as a door number; any requests that come to the server will come via that door. Setting a port will allow us to find where our server is running.\nWe use the app.listen method to do this. This method takes two arguments: a port and a callback function telling it what to do once the server is running. Need clarification? Read more about the app.listen method in the Express documentation.\nWe're going to run our server on port 3000, and run a simple console.log as our callback function. Update your server.js file, calling the app.listen method:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log('Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!');\n});\n\n\nTry to use ES6 arrow functions instead of function.\n\n5. Switch the server on!\nYou've built your server, but it isn't running yet. We need to run a command in the terminal to do this. We are going to use the node keyword to run the server file.\nType the following command in your terminal:\n$ node server.js\nIf you see this, congratulations! You have built yourself a server!\n\nStep 4 - Communicating with the server\nNow that we've built the server, we need to communicate with it. We're going to control the server with handler functions.\nWhat is a handler function?\nWhen a request reaches the server, we need a way of responding to it. In comes the handler function. The handler function is just a function which receives requests and handles them, hence the name.\nThe handler function always takes a request and response object, and sends the response back to the client along with some information. You can decide what to send back in your response.\nWhat does a handler function look like in Express?\nThe get() method is used to define a handler function in Express. It takes two parameters: the endpoint at which to trigger an action (we'll explain more about this in the next step), and the handler function that tells it exactly what to do. Here's a simple \"Hello World!\" example:\n// req is the Request object, res is the Response object\n// (these are just variable names, they can be anything but it's a convention to call them req and res)\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n    res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\n Here, we are telling our server to respond with \"Hello World!\" when someone tries to access the webpage.\n1. Create your own handler function.\nWe are now making a handler function with a custom message in our response. You can write any message you want.\nUpdate your server.js file with an empty app.get() function:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Try to console.log the request object inside the handler function. Restart your server, refresh the browser, then go to your terminal to see what it looks like. You should see a lot of data come through.\n\n2. Tell your handler function what to do\nWe want our handler function to send back a message to the client. To do that, we're going to use the Express send() method. This will update the response object with the message.\nUpdate your handler function like so:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Yay Node Girls!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n3. Check it out in your browser\nQuit your server in the terminal with ctrl + c. Then restart it to run your new changes.\n$ node server.js\nNow, open your favourite browser (we like Chrome), and navigate to http://localhost:3000. If you see your message in the browser, congratulations! You just sent your first response from the server.\nStep 5 - Routing\nAt the moment our server only does one thing. When it receives a request from the / endpoint, it sends back the same response: \"Yay Node Girls!\".\n\nTry typing http://localhost:3000/nodegirls and see what happens.\n\nHowever by making use of endpoints, we can make the server send different responses for different requests. This concept is called routing.\nWhat is an endpoint?\nAn endpoint is the part of the URL which comes after /. For example: /chocolate is the \"chocolate\" endpoint. It's the URL to which you send a request.\nWhat is URL?\n \n1. Create your own endpoints and send different responses\nWe're going to try sending different responses at different endpoints. Remember the app.get() method? To set up routing in your server, we just need to repeat this method with different endpoints.\nFor example:\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n    res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.get(\"/chocolate\", function (req, res) {\n    res.send(\"Mm chocolate :O\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add some code so that your server sends one message when the endpoint is /node and another one when it's /girls.\n\nStep 6 - Serving static files\nSo we know how to send back a simple message. But what if you want to send back a whole HTML page, or an image?\nThings like HTML files, images etc are known as static assets. If you want your server to \"serve\" static assets back to the browser, you need to do something different than just using the res.send() method.\nTo be able to send any file from the server we need a special, built-in middleware function that comes with Express: express.static(). Read more about it here.\nSay we want to serve all the static assets in our \"public\" folder. The express.static() function will look like this:\napp.use(express.static(\"public\"));\n\n1. Serve static files from your server\nDelete all your app.get endpoint functions, and replace them with the line of code above. Restart your server, refresh your browser and see what happens! If you see a Node Girls CMS, then your static assets have been successfully served.\nHTTP request methods\nAll requests use one of the HTTP methods. The main ones are: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\napp.get deals with requests that use the GET HTTP method.\n\nWe will go into these Methods into more details, but for now, think of GET as a method for Getting data. POST is for POSTing/inserting new data. PUT is for updating. DELETE is for deleting data.\n\nThe POST http request method\nWhen sending data to the server, we use the POST http request method, instead of GET.\nLet's try POSTing some text to the server.\nWe're going to add a form to the index.html page, so that you can write your blogposts from there.\nOpen up the index.html file in your text editor.  If you have a look, you should see this:\n\n    \n\n\nReplace the greyed-out comment with this code snippet:\nCreate a blog post\n\n    \n    Send\n\n\n\nThis form has a text area and a Send button.  \nThe action attribute is the endpoint form data will be sent to.\nThe name attribute will be used later to reference the data.\n\nWhen you hit Send, the form will send a POST request to the server, using whatever is in the action attribute as the endpoint.  In our case it's /create-post.\n\nExercise: Open Chrome Developers tool, click the button and see what happens.\n\nReceiving the blog post on the server\n\nData doesn't come through the server in one go; it flows to the server in a stream.  Think of a stream as water flowing from a tap into a bucket.  Your job is to collect this water in the server.\n\nIf we were writing a pure Node server, we would have to think about how to collect the stream of data properly.  But luckily for us, Express handles all of that stuff under the hood.  \n\nAll you need to do is define a route to deal with requests that come through on the /create-post endpoint.\n\n\nLet's remind ourselves of a simple GET route in Express:\napp.get('/hello-world', function (req, res) {\n    res.send('Hello there!');\n});\n\n\nExercise: This time we want to define a route to deal with a POST request not a GET.  What do you think you would need to do differently?  Experiment and see if you can define a route for the /create-post endpoint!\nFor now, make your /create-post handler simply do this: console.log('I am /create-post endpoint').\n\n\nExtracting the blog post\nNow the contents of your blogpost is hidden in your req object somewhere.  Normally you would extract it using req.body.  Try to console.log req.body now.\nGetting undefined?  Not to worry, that's normal.  When data has been POSTed to the server as FormData, we need to do things slightly differently to access the data that's come through in the request.\nWe need another middleware function.  Something that can get extract the contents out of the special FormData object.  For this we will use express-formidable.  express-formidable is another Express middleware. It will extract the form data from the request and make it available to you when you do req.fields.\nThis time though, express-formidable is not built-in, we need to explicitly install it.\nIn your terminal, install express-formidable\nnpm install express-formidable --save\n\nrequire express-formidable so you can use it in your code.  You can't use dashes in JavaScript variable names, so just call it const formidable.\nconst formidable = require('express-formidable');\n\nNow add this towards the top of your server, after your requires and app.use(express.static('public')), but before your /create-post endpoint:\napp.use(formidable());\n\nNow inside your /create-post function, add:\nconsole.log(req.fields);\n\nRefresh your server and have another go at writing a blogpost.\nYou should now see an object in the console.  The key should be blogpost, just like the name attribute in the form on the HTML page.  The value of blogpost will be your message!\n\nExercise: Try putting app.use(formidable()); at the end of the file (after the create-post but before starting the server)\nWhat is a middleware in Express? Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware. Read more on the Express documentation\n\nStep 8 - Saving your blog post\nRight now, your precious blog posts aren't being saved anywhere, which is a bit of a shame.  Let's do something about that.\nYou'll note that in the data folder there's a new file called posts.json.\nIf you look at posts.json will see there's already one blog post there. The format is:\n{\n    [timestamp]: [blog post message]\n}\n\nWe've used a timestamp as the key so that the blog posts are listed in chronological order. Also, it's a record of when the blog post was created.\nWriting to your hard drive\nAnytime a blog post comes through to the server, we want to save the data on your computer's hard drive.  To do this, we need to use a built-in Node module: fs, which stands for 'file-system'.\nBuilt-in Node modules - core Node modules - are rather like the built-in Express middleware functions.  Only difference is that where you need to have installed Express to use Express middleware functions, the core Node modules come automatically with Node itself.\nTo use fs, you'll need to require it at the top of your server file:\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nThe method we need to write to your hard drive is fs.writeFile.\nfs.writeFile('path/to/file', yourData, function (error) {\n    // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to write to\nArgument 2: the data you want to write\nArgument 3: the callback function\n\nThe 'path/to/file' will be replaced with the actual path to the file you want to write to.  If it doesn't exist, fs.writeFile cleverly creates one for you.  But we already have posts.json, so not to worry.\nReading from your hard drive\nTo read data that's already there, you would use fs.readFile.  The way to use fs.readFile is very similar to fs.writeFile:\nfs.readFile('path/to/file', function (error, file) {\n    // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to write to\nArgument 2: the callback function\n\nYou'll notice that fs.readFile's callback function takes a second argument.  That argument would be the file you're reading.\nLet's read the data from the posts.json file.  Make sure you've required the fs core Node module at the top of your server file somewhere.\nAdd this code to your server (put it anywhere after the requires for now):\nfs.readFile(__dirname + '/data/posts.json', function (error, file) {\n\n    console.log(file);\n});\n\n(__dirname is a Node global object that gives you a path to current working directory. It's handy if we want to avoid writing the whole path out in full.)\nIf you restart the server, you'll probably see something like this:\n\n\nThis is actually the contents of your posts.json file, but in a format called a buffer.  To make it a bit more human-readable, you can console.log the file to a string, like this:\nconsole.log(file.toString());\n\nfile is in JSON format right now.  If we want to access the blog post message inside file, we need to parse it from JSON back to a JavaScipt object.\nAdd this next bit of code to your fs.readFile's callback function:\nconst parsedFile = JSON.parse(file);\n\nNow parsedFile is a normal JavaScript object, and we can access the data inside it.\nOk, so we've talked about JSON and we've talked about reading and writing files.  You now have the power to save new blog post data to your hard drive!  Work with your partner and your mentor to see if you can figure the next steps out on your own.\nHere's a breakdown of what you want to achieve:\n\nWhen new blog post data comes through, read from posts.json to access its contents\nAdd your new blog post data to the old ones.\nWrite your new combined data back to the posts.json file.\n\nThings to remember\n\nfs.writeFile() normally overwrites the target file you've given it.  Chances are you don't want to lose all your old blog posts every time you get a new one, so think about how you can combine fs.readFile() and fs.writeFile() to prevent overwriting.\n\nYou will need to convert between JSON and a JavaScript object several times.  JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() are what you need.\n\n\nOh by the way, if you want to get the current timestamp, use the JavaScript Date.now() method.\nStep 9 - Displaying your blog posts\nSo now we're saving the blog posts to the server.  Time to get them and display them on the page!\nIf you look inside public/script.js, there's a whole bunch of JavaScript code in there.  Don't worry about what all the code means, just know that it's responsible for sending a request to GET old blog posts and display them on the page underneath \"Recent Posts\".\nscript.js is trying to load existing posts by making a GET request. Look inside script.js and see if you can find any useful endpoints.\nYour script.js file will want to receive the JSON containing your blog posts.  Your job is to make that happen!\nExpress has a handy method called res.sendFile() that makes it easy to send files back to the client.  Feel free to use this with your JSON.\nIf all goes well, you should have a fully functional CMS!\nGroup Research Topics\n\nSecurity: (https, same origin, cookies, xss etc..)\nPerformance: Request lifecycle (from browser to server and back), Performance considerations and optimisations\nHTTP and REST: (headers, status codes, Cookies, REST)\nNode internals: Node event loop, Node core modules, async/sync (non-blocking operations)\n\nThe research will be on a Github repo. One member of the group will be responsible of creating a repo, the others will fork it and create Pull Requests for it (that the main repo's owner will have to review and merge).\nWe expect each repo to have commits from each member of the group\nHomework\n\nFinish the tasks from the workshop\nTry adding an /about route to your app to serve some HTML. How is this different from using express's static middleware?

Wouldn't be nice if we could change one file and that reflects in all pages.\nAt the moment, we're just serving static HTML files from the public folder. NodeJS and ExpressJS allows us to build dynamic web pages.\n\nA server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server that processes server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nWebsites - a small detour\nWhat is wrong with this website?  \nIs this one any better?  \nThe final view is here  \nWhat was missing in the first example? \n   \nSo what is the point of all these?  \n   \nTemplate Engines\nA template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page, as it reduces duplicate code (DRY).\nSome popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache, and EJS.\nHandlebars Templating Engine\nWe will use Handlebars as the templating engine for this class.\nTo add it to your project:\nnpm install --save express-handlebars\nThen in your server.js, we need to configure the middleware for Handlebars.\n\n// Add this to the top of your file\nconst exphbs  = require('express-handlebars');\n\n// Then these two lines after you initialise your express app \napp.engine('handlebars', exphbs({ defaultLayout: 'main' }));\napp.set('view engine', 'handlebars');\n\n\nLet's look at the folder views/layouts/main.handlebars\n\n\nThere is a placeholder for body where the \"body\" get injected - can you find it?\nNotice the index.handlebars, my-cv.handlebars and admin.handlebars.\n\nThen add these routes:\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n    res.render('index');\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add similar endpoints for /my-cv and /admin.\nExercise: Let's create a template called contact and delete the endpoint we created earlier for /contact - render a view instead - similar to what we did with the previous endpoints.\nExercise: Remember how we changed Contact to Contact Information? Try to change now Contact Information to Get in touch. Was it any easier? \n\nTemplate passing info from Controller to Template\nWhen we were using the static HTML pages from public/ folder - the heading text shown on top of the page (on the photo) used to change when we go to different pages. Now that we switched to the template, we've lost that behavior as the code for this part comes from the centralised Layout (views/layouts/main.handlebars).\nHow can we imitate that behavior without having to duplicate code or serve static files? Express and Handlebars allow you to pass data between the routes and the views. Here is how we can do it:\n\nLet's modify the / route to pass the title of the page.\n app.get('/', function (req, res) {\n     res.render('index', {\n         title: 'Etzali Profile', // insert your name instead \n     });\n });\n\n\nIn /views/layouts/main.handlebars, let's use the data we're passing to the template\n \n     \n         \n             \n             \n             \n             A modern Website built in Node\n         \n     \n \n\n\n\n\nExercise: Pass the subheading from the route to the view as well.\nExercise: Change Title to default to \"My Profile\" if no title was provided. Look at #if helpers for Handlebars http://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html\n\nPartials\nHandlebars allows for template reuse through partials. Partials are normal Handlebars templates that may be called directly by other templates. (Handlebars documentation)\nLet's put the Menu in a partial.\n\nGo to layout/main.handlebars and cut the  with all its contents, and move it to a new file called menu.handlebars under views/partials.\n\nThen to use the partial, add {{> menu}} in the place where you cut the original menu from.\nMore Templating\nThere is much more that can be done with Handlebars templating engine. Skim through the express-handlebars and handlebars documentation\nFor now, we will finish by using the each helper.\nDynamically loading the templates\n{{#each posts}}\n    \n        \n            \n                {{this.title}}\n            \n            \n                {{this.summary}}\n            \n        \n    \n{{/each}}\n\nIn the route, let's load the file in data/posts.json:\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n    const filePath = __dirname + '/data/posts.json';\n    const callbackFunction = function(error, file) {\n        // we call .toString() to turn the file buffer to a String\n        const fileData = file.toString();\n        // we use JSON.parse to get an object out the String\n        const postsJson = JSON.parse(fileData);\n        // send the json to the Template to render\n        res.render('index', {\n          title: 'Etzali Profile', // insert your name instead\n          posts: postsJson\n        });\n    };\n    fs.readFile(filePath, callbackFunction);\n});\n\nCallbacks\nIn JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. That means they can be used in a first class manner like any other object since they are objects themselves. We can pass them as arguments to functions which is common technique in JavaScript for dealing with asynchronous behaviour. We have in fact already encountered callbacks when we looked at array methods such as .forEach(), .map() and .filter.\nconst evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];\nevenNumbers.forEach(function( num ) {\n    console.log(num);\n});\n\nHere we are passing the function( num ) {console.log(num);} function as an argument to .forEach() to execute with each item in the array evenNumbers.\nThe above example is synchronous which means that code the callback is executed immediately. Let's look at an example where the code is executed asynchronously. We will use a setTimeout function to delay execution here. In most JavaScript applications asynchronous code execution could be in response to an event such as mouse click or data coming back from a server. We will look at both of those cases in detail in a future class.\nfunction delay(callback){\n    setTimeout( callback, 2000 );\n}\n\nfunction logRandom(){\n    const value = Math.round( Math.random() * 10);\n    console.log( value );\n    return value;\n}\n\ndelay(logRandom);\n\nKey points\n\nFunctions can be passed as arguments to other other function\nFunctions that are passed as arguments are called callbacks\nCallbacks may be executed immediately or later\nIf a callback is executed later, its return value is lost\n\n\nExercise: What other Asynchronous operations have we recently used in the Node code we've written?\nExercise: On the CV page, there is a button, Get Repos List, that doesn't work. There is code to make it work at js\\github-client.js. Add js\\github-client.js to your pages.\n\nThe client-side code in github-client.js should look familiar.\n\nExercise: Identify all the callbacks in this code. Refactor the anonymous functions to their own variables and use the variables instead. (Bonus point if you use arrow functions)\n\nCallback hell\nIn the code where we retrieve the repos data from Github, imagine if we had a requirement, that for each repo retrieved, we have to make another API call to retrieve all the available branches (there is a property called branches_url that we can use to get that info). And then, once we have all the branches, make another API call to get the info for each branch.\nThe code to do so, will look something similar to this:\nvar oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\noReq.addEventListener('load', function() {\n    var oReq2 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    oReq2.addEventListener('load', function() {\n        var oReq3 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        oReq2.addEventListener('load', function() {\n            // 4. Now we finally have all the info we need and we can the info we retrieved from the three API calls.\n\n        });\n        oReq3.open('GET', url); // 3. third url for branch info\n        oReq3.send();\n    });\n    oReq.open('GET', url); // 2. second url for branches\n    oReq.send();\n});\noReq.open('GET', url); // 1. first url for Repo\noReq.send();\n\nThe code above is very hard to understand and follow. Notice the pyramid shape }) - This is often called the callback hell.\nAPIs\nAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for applications to communicate with each other. We already consumed an API earlier in the day: Github API. We managed to communicate with Github and get important information. We - the client - can use this information in a number of different ways. Our client, in this case, is a Web page but it could have easily been a Mobile Application, or a TV setbox etc...\n\nLet's watch this video about APIs - What is an API\nExercise: Let's expose the posts.json as an API for other clients to consume through the url /api/get-posts.\nHint: make use res.sendFile\n\nREST API\nREST (REpresentational State Transfer) and RESTful APIs provide a way (an architecture) for building APIs that is simple and scalable.\nThere are many constraints and aspects to building a REST API, but one fundamental constraint is the use of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc..)\nIn our endpoint that we just created /api/get-posts, the get part of the URL is redundant as the HTTP Method GET already tells that we are GETting a Resource. The Resource in this case is called posts.\n\nExercise: Let's rename our endpoint to /posts so that it follows RESTful architecture.\nWhat would the endpoint for creating posts be called?\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA - What is a REST API (up to 3 minutes)\n\nREST is a big topic that we will revisit again. The table below from Wikipedia shows how a typical RESTful API would look like.\n\nWikipedia\nFor now, remember when building APIs, to use Resource names to identify your endpoints and make use of the HTTP methods (Verbs) to describe operations performed on those resources.\nDeploying to Heroku\nHeroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that lets companies build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps. Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. Heroku is fully managed, giving developers the freedom to focus on their core product without the distraction of maintaining servers, hardware, or infrastructure.\n\nGo to https://signup.heroku.com/ and signup for an account\nIt will send a verification to your email so make sure you've entered a valid email\n\n\nDownload the Heroku CLI from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install\nWe need to do a small tweak to our app to be ready to be deployed on Heroku.\n\nOn server.js, add the process.env.PORT bit of code\napp.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\nThis tells our server to look for an environment variable called PORT and use it to run the server, otherwise use Port 3000. When the server runs on heroku, then Heroku sets the PORT to the correct value.\ngit add and commit your change.\n\nNow open the command line in the folder where you have your express-workshop repo running. If you run the command git remote -v, you should see one remote origin pointing to your repo.\n\nRun these commands:\nheroku login\n\nThis will ask you for your heroku email and password that you used to register. \n\nOnce you're logged in:\nheroku create\n\nThe heroku create command creates a new application on Heroku â€“ along with a git remote that must be used to receive your application source.\n\nIf you check git remote -v, you should see a second remote called heroku.\nNow push your code to heroku git push heroku master. The push will run few commands from Heroku, then you should see a url similar to https://some-random-name-XXXX.herokuapp.com - go to the URL and if all goes well, your app should be up and running.\nTo read more about Heroku and deploying Node Apps to Heroku, check\nhttps://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git and https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up\nHomework\n\nDeploy to Heroku if you haven't yet\nAdd a route posts/:postid that displays a specific post - Read about route parameters on Express documentation\nWhen the user clicks on a route in the home page, navigate them to your route.\nAmend your JSON structure to have a postId that you can use it to identify which post we want to display.\n\n\nImplement the Admin page. \nWrite a posts endpoint that you can hit and that should save to the JSON file (use the helper functions we added under helpers/savePost)\nMake an AJAX call from the front end (the admin page) to your new endpoint.\nYou might need to use formidable or body-parser middleware to get the data on the server.\n\n\nConsume a posts API built by another colleague (and deployed to Heroku) to display their latest blog posts. You can display the posts on any page that you see suitable (or add a new page).\nSecure the Admin page so that it's only visible if a certain query parameter is provided\nCan you go a bit further with adding proper security?

Lots of people are giving freely of their time and knowledge to make the class possible and giving up other commitments to be here. Respect that, and always be on time.\n\nLeave our space cleaner and tidier than when we arrive. We are hosted by generous folks who are offering their space (and time) to help us - the least we can do is to keep their space tidy and clean, and consider it our own.\n\nCommunication is key (and in English). Setup Slack on your phone and computer, and use it all the time to ask and provide help, enquire about the classes etc... Also, the classes help lots of the students (and volunteers!) to improve their English as a nice side effect, so even if you share a language with some of the participants, resist the temptation and speak in English!\n\nLearn to find answers. A big part of what we teach you is about researching and finding answers by yourself - get in the habit of Googling and finding answers to your questions.\n\nAlways be in control of the keyboard and mouse. Don't let the mentors take control of your keyboard and mouse, don't let them type for you, ask for help but do things yourself!\n\nHelp each other. As students, you're the most qualified to help each other, as you're going through the same journey of learning - offer and ask for help from your fellow students (helping someone else is also one of the best ways to improve your own skills)\n\nWe are a community.
