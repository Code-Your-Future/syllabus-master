Syllabus  \nThis is the syllabus and course material for\nCode Your Future, a not-for-profit volunteer-run\ncoding school for refugees and asylum seekers.\nDuring the course you will learn a technology stack that helps you build\nanything from a simple website to a powerful database-driven web application or\neven a mobile app!\nThe six-months course contains:\n\nHTML/CSS\nCore JavaScript\nBackend development using NodeJS\nModern front-end development with React\n\nWe’ll complement the training with workshops on modern software methodologies\nand job interview practices, etc.\nContributing\nThe current syllabus is thanks to the hard work by our amazing\nmentors who have\ndedicated many hours to discussing and contributing content and teaching.\nPlease read our Contributing guide to get started with how\nyou can contribute to the CYF syllabus, or the projects we have for our\nstudents.\nGetting involved\nDo you want to get involved? we are looking for:\n\nLead Mentors (in London, Glasgow and Manchester)\nFun projects and workshops for learning Javascript\nPR Reviewers for student homeworks\nOther volunteers\n\nPlease contact us to get involved!\n"},"others/lesson0.html":{"url":"others/lesson0.html","title":"Week 0","keywords":"","body":"\nLesson 0\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nCodeYourFuture\nWelcome task\nTerminal\nGit\nIDEs\nHomework\n\n\nCodeYourFuture\n\nWho we are?\nWhat we learn?\nRead this Technology Survey from\nStackOverflow. Pay\nparticular attention to the technologies we'll be teaching you (JavaScript,\nReact, NodeJS)\n\n\nHouse Rules\nHow we work?\nHow we treat each other?\n\n\nStandup\n\nWelcome!\nWelcome to CodeYourFuture and to the world of Web Development! Now that you have\nbuilt a website in CodePen and learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it's time to\nlearn about the tools that web developers use in their everyday job. These tools\nwill be used during the course, so it is important that you become familiarised\nwith them.\nIn order to get started, we would like you to try to complete a task at home:\nmove your CodePen website to a web address under\nhttps://your-username.github.io/your-site-name.\nIn the process, you will learn how to store your code outside CodePen's website,\nin a location where other developers can make changes to it and view a history\nof all the updates that you have made.\nIf you wish to learn more about the concepts behind the steps we are suggesting\nbelow, please read the rest of this document.\nAnd remember: it's ok if you are stuck and don't know how to continue. At any\npoint, please ask for a mentor's help. We will cover these steps again in the\nlesson, and will explain them in more detail.\nHow to move your website to Github.io\n\nExport your website as a zip from CodePen.\nHelp >\nExtract the contents of the zip file to a folder in your computer. Keep note\nof the location of this folder.\nRead about the terminal.\nRead about git.\nInstall Git.\nPut the contents of the zip folder in a Gitub repository.\nHow does Github work? (30min) >\nYou should now have a page with your code under\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name. This is a view of\nyour code, and you should see a list of your files, including an\nindex.html.\nNow all that remains is to publish your website! Still under\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name, find the settings\nicon in the top right corner.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFind the section named \"Github Pages\" and select \"master branch\" in source,\nthen hit \"Save\".\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWait a few minutes, then refresh the page and come back to the Github Pages\nsection. You should see a green bar saying \"Your site is published at\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name\". Click the link,\nverify that your website is there, then share it with your CYF class!\n\nTerminal basics\nDuring your course journey and onwards, the terminal (also known as\ncommand line) will be one of your most valuable tools. It will help you to\ninteract with you computer faster, by helping you to:\n\nCreate and delete files.\nInstall web development tools.\nStart a server.\nUse source control (explained later in this lesson).\n\nAll this will make sense as we progress with the lessons. For now, we would like\nyou to get familiar with it by following this tutorial:\n\nLearn the command line >\n\nHow do I use it on my computer?\nSo now that you know what the terminal can do for you, how do you use it? Please\nfind instructions for your operating system below. After you have followed the\ninstructions, open a terminal and write ls, then press the Enter key. You\nwill see something like this:\n\n  \n\n\nLinux\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications\navailable in your computer.\nMore instructions >\nmacOS (Apple)\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications\navailable in your computer.\nMore instructions >\nWindows\nInstall Git. It will bring with it a tool\ncalled \"Git Bash\". When the mentors ask you to open a terminal or command line,\nplease open \"Git Bash\".\nGit\nWe will use Git as our Version Control System (also known as Source Control).\nIt's like Dropbox for developers. But much better!\n\nWhat is \"version control\"? Version control is a system that records\nchanges to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific\nversions later.\nIt allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire\nproject back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last\nmodified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue\nand when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things\nup or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for\nvery little overhead.\nExtract from\nGit Pro book\n\nThis answer on StackOverflow by\nsi618 explains very well why we\nuse Version Control.\nSo what is Git? Git is one of many Version Control Systems available to use,\nand by far\nthe most popular.\nWhat is Github? Github is a very popular site where you can publish and\nshare your Git repositories, share and collaborate with other people.\nGet Started\nFollow this tutorial from Github to setup Git\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/\nThen\nlearn how to use git from the Terminal >\nTry completing this tutorial > as well to learn more\nintermediate features, like branching.\nA typical workflow\n\nIf you're basing your work from another project, the first step is typically\nto fork their repo. Read this guide for instructions\n(https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)\n\nIf you're starting a new project then you should follow these steps\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/\n\n\nUsing Git through the Terminal\n\ngit init if it is a new project, i.e. a project not cloned from a\nrepo (or a fork of a repo)\ngit add . to add local files to the index\ngit commit -m \"Good explanation of your file changes\" to commit files to the\nlocal repo\ngit remote add origin GitRepoRemoteUrl if it is a new project (to\nsetup the remote url)\ngit remote -v to verify that the remote url is set correctly\ngit push -u origin master to push your commits to the remote url (Github in\nour case)\n\nYou will also typically need to set up your email and name once when you install\nGit git config --global user.name  and `git config --global user.email\n`.\nUsing Git through a graphical interface\nIf you don't feel comfortable with the terminal just yet, download the\nGithub client. If possible, however, we\nrecommend becoming comfortable with the Terminal commands and understanding the\nsteps for the different workflows before moving on to visual Git clients.\nGithub client guides >\nPull Requests\nYou should also learn how to create and work with\nPull Requests.\nGithub\nDuring our course, we will be using Github to store our\ncode. Github is the most popular Git service around, and is used by many large\ncompanies, like Facebook, Airbnb and The Guardian.\nCodeYourFuture's Github page >\nMore Resources\n\nFollow this tutorial to learn the basic Git commands\nhttps://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git\nAnother good resource: Git - the simple guide\nhttp://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\nA more detailed tutorial that goes into advanced topics of Git -\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control\nYou can also check this visual explanation of different commands and what they\ndo: http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace\nThere are GUI software - Gitkraken is one of them https://www.gitkraken.com/\nThis Glossary has definitions of the terms normally used with Git:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/\n\nIDE\nIDE stands for \"Integrated Development Environment\". It is the software that you\nwill be using to write most of your code. It is designed to help you develop\nyour apps quickly, focusing on the problems that you need to solve instead of\nhaving to search Google for minor details.\nAuto-complete\nOne of the most important features of an IDE is that it provides\n\"auto-completion\". This means that it will give you suggestions of what you can\ncan write next, while you are typing something.\nFor example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can\nassign it to.\n\n  \n\n\nFile tree view\nThe reason why we call it \"Integrated\" is that you almost don't need to leave\nthe window to write your app. For example, creating, renaming and moving files\ncan be done directly from the IDE. This functionality can be achieved from\nsomething called a \"Tree view\", which you can usually find on the left side of\nyour IDE.\n\n  \n\n\nFinding files\nWhen working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly,\nwithout having to go through the tree view manually.\n\n  \n\n\nMost IDEs will allow you to do this with a sequence of keys.\nVSCode sequence: Windows/Linux Ctrl + P | Mac Cmd + P\nInstall an IDE\nFor this course, we recommend the usage of\nVS Code. Please go ahead and install it, then\ntry opening an HTML file with it via File > Open.\nInstall VS Code >\nOther IDEs\nBesides VS Code, the IDEs below are also popular with web developers. Feel free\nto check out their websites and see the differences between them and VS Code.\n\nAtom\nWebstorm\n\nHomework\n\nIf you have not yet moved your website from CodePen to Github, do it now.\nPlease use the information in this section to complete it.\nWhen your website is live at https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name,\nplease send a link to the slack channel of your class.\nLearn how to navigate your computer using a Terminal (view files, copy files).\nInstall VS Code.\nOpen your website with VS Code and add something to it: text, images, update\nCSS. Commit your changes to Github and verify that\nhttps://your-username.github.io/your-site-name has been updated!\n\nIt's alright if you are getting stuck or if something doesn't look right! When\nit happens, please ask your mentors or classmates for help in Slack.\n"},"html-css/":{"url":"html-css/","title":"HTML/CSS","keywords":"","body":"HTML & CSS\n\n\n\nWeeks\nContent\n\n\n\n\nweek-01\nSemantic HTML tags .

(Wikipedia)\n\nPrinciples - During the course, we will highlight principles that apply to\nthe specific topic but also to Computer Science and Programming in general. It\nis important to understand these principles, terms and apply them to your\nthinking in general.\n\nHTML Syntax\nYou're already familiar with HTML code from your application process. If you\nwant to refresh your memory, read this\nquick guide to the HTML syntax.\nAll together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example:\n\n    Learning HTML\n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\n\n\nExercise Which parts are the Tags and which parts are the\nAttributes.\n\nHTML tags are arranged in a hierarchy. This is sometimes called \"nesting\" tags\nor creating an HTML \"tree\". Between the opening  tag and the closing\n tag there are three other tags. We call these \"child\" tags, because\nthey have a parent-child relationship.\n\n\nExercise As a group, let's try to name all of the parent and child tags in\nthe following example.\n\n\n    Learning HTML\n    \n        Author:\n        Code Your Future\n    \n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\n\nExample HTML/CSS Project\nIn today's class, we will begin adapting styles on this example website. We'll\nreview some of the HTML/CSS basics you already encountered during your\napplication process and learn some new techniques. By the end of the third\nlesson, we will have worked together to improve the example site on the left so\nthat it looks like the screenshot on the right.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nThe example website you'll begin working with is available\non this GitHub repository.\nFork the repository to your personal account and use the following terminal\ncommands to download the files to your projects folder.\n\ncd ~\ncd \ngit clone git@github.com:/bikes-for-refugees.git\n\n\nExercise: Spend a few minutes exploring the .html and .css files for\nthis page. Why don't we put everything in one file?\n\nSemantic HTML\nWhen writing HTML code, you can use different tags to describe the content. Is\nit a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct\ntag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually\nimpaired.\n\nSemantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or\nmeaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than\nmerely to define its presentation or look.\nWikipedia\n\nWe'll cover the following semantic tags:\n\n\n\nThe role=\"main\" attribute\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise (pair programming): Work in pairs to determine where to place\nthese new Tags and Attributes in the index.html file. Who benefits when we\nwrite \"semantic\" HTML?\n\nCSS Selectors\nDuring your application process, you became familiar with CSS selectors. We'll\nreview the basic selectors and then practice combining these to modify our\nbutton styles.\n\nIf you want to review the selectors, read the\nCommon Selectors section\nof this page.\nExercise (pair programming): Work in pairs to make the blue buttons on the\npage red (#ce5f31). The white button, which says \"Volunteer\", should remain\nwhite but the text should change to red.\n\nCSS Inheritance\nSome CSS styles applied to one element will be \"inherited\" by their child\nelements. These are usually styles which apply to the content of the elements,\nsuch as font family and color. Other properties, like margins, paddings and\nborders, don't get passed down to children.\n\nIn English, the word inherit refers to something, like the color of your\neyes, which you can receive from your parent. We use this to describe how\n\"child\" HTML elements can inherit styles from \"parent\" HTML elements.\n\nWe'll do two quick exercises to explore what gets inherited, what doesn't, and\nwhy.\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the\nbackground properties\nto add a ../assets/jumbotron-background.jpg to the\njumbotron. Did these styles have \"inheritance\"? Why do you think they did or\ndid not?\n\nNow that the background image is in place, the text is difficult to read. The\ntext needs to be white.\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use just one CSS rule to set all of the text\nin the jumbotron to white. To do this, you'll need to use inheritance. Why do\nyou think some styles, like text color, get inherited?\n\nPseudo Classes\nYou can assign CSS rules to a class like this:\n.btn {\n  background: #ce5f31;\n}\n\nThere are also things called \"pseudo\" classes. In this section, we'll introduce\nyou to the common pseudo classes for assigning styles to interactions, such as\nmoving your mouse over a link.\n\n\"pseudo\" is a fancy word for \"fake\". We call them \"pseudo\" classes because\nthey're not really there in the HTML, but the browser knows what to do with\nthem.\n\nHere's an example of a pseudo class which changes the color of a link when the\nmouse moves over it.\n.btn:hover {\n  background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\nNot everyone uses a mouse. Some users will prefer a keyboard, where they can hit\ntab to move between links on a page. So that they can see where they are, you\nshould add effects to the :focus pseudo class too.\n.btn:hover,\n.btn:focus {\n  background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the pseudo classes to make the background\ncolor of the red buttons change when in a \"hover\" or \"focus\" state. See if you\ncan make the white \"Volunteer\" button change to a different background without\neffecting the red buttons.\n\nThe Cascade\nCSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The \"cascade\" is a set of rules which the\nbrowser uses to choose what to do when two CSS rules conflict. Take the\nfollowing example:\n.btn {\n  color: red;\n}\n.btn {\n  color: blue;\n}\n\nShould the .btn be red or blue? When identical selectors are next to each\nother like this, the browser lets the last one override the first one. But in a\nreal-world scenario, you may have CSS scattered across different files. To solve\nthis, we use the cascade.\n\nExercise: Read the section on\nthe cascade.\nThen pair up. In the example, there are two paragraphs. Pick one paragraph and\nexplain to your partner why it has a particular background color. Then ask\nyour partner to explain the other paragraph.\nExercise: Work in pairs to give each one of the navigation menu items a\nred border (#ce5f31). This border should only appear when the mouse is\nhovering over it or the item has focus. Then use what you've learned about the\ncascade to give the first navigation menu item (\"Home\") a different color\nborder.\n\nBox Model\nIn CSS, everything is a box. An image is a box. A link is a box. The area around\nthis box can be modified with properites that we call margins, borders and\npadding. Here's a diagram showing what the box looks like.\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the margin and padding rules to spread\nyour navigation links out a bit wider. There should be a small gap between\nthem and enough padding so that the border is not too tight on the text.\n\nYou may have noticed that the border you added to the navigation links causes\nthe links to jump around when you move your mouse over them. That's because the\nborder is adding to the width of the box model, pushing the others to the side.\nYou can also set a transparent border, so that it takes up the space without\nshowing a visible border.\n.navlink {\n  border: 1px solid transparent;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Use a transparent border so that the width of each navigation\nmenu item stays the same even when it is hovered or focused.\n\nResources\n\nHTML5 - semantic elements\nCSS Selectors - MDN\nThe Cascade - MDN\nBox Model - MDN\nBox Model, box-sizing: border-box - CSS Tricks\nCSS specificity - MDN\nPseudo classes - MDN\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 2 hours) Read about\nadvanced CSS selectors\nand then practice by playing this\nCSS selector game.

To ensure we're presenting a website that's easy to\nuse on any device, we use Responsive Web Design techniques to modify how content\nis displayed depending on the viewport.\n\nExercise: As a group, let's brainstorm as many devices as we can think of\nwhich might access the websites we build.\n\nSee how much variety there is in\nviewport sizes.\nMedia Queries\nAs you learned in your homework assignment, media queries help us change the\ndisplay of our content depending on the size of the viewport. Let's review what\nyou learned and break down a media query:\n@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n  body {\n    background: red;\n  }\n}\n\nIn this media query, we're assigning a red background color to the \nelement whenever the viewport is larger than 900px, and we're viewing on a\nscreen.\n\n@media starts the media query\nscreen tells it to apply these styles to screen displays. Other displays\nmight be print, for when a webpage is being printed.\n(min-width: 900px) tells it to apply these styles when the viewport is\nlarger than 900px\n\nFinally, we wrap all of our styles for this media query in brackets ({ and\n}), just like a CSS rule.\n\nExercise: Working in pairs, reduce the size of the \"Bikes for Refugees\"\ntext so that it fits on a small screen (320px). But make sure it increases\nin size on larger screens. Exercise: The two buttons in the jumbotron\ndon't fit on the same line on small screens around 320px wide. Can you\nadjust their size so that they fit on the same line?\n\nFlexbox\nFlexbox is a name for a set of CSS layout rules which are supported in newer\nbrowsers for Content Layout. They allow you to apply rules to elements to\nplace them side-by-side and re-arrange them. You just specify how you want your\nelements arranged and the browser will scale this arrangement depending on the\nscreen size and device used for viewing.\nMost flexbox rules are applied to the container, to tell it how to arrange its\nchildren. However, there are some rules that can be applied to children as well.\nYou can see all the rules that can be applied to both the container and the\nchildren here\n\nExercise: Continue editing the \"Bike for refugees\" website by adding 3\nboxes below Jumbotron, and using Flexbox, make sure they are arranged like in\nthe sketch below:\n\n\nIf you finish early, you can add some text in each box and position it in the\nmiddle of the box.\n\nExercise: Working independently, try to position the articles and images\nside-by-side under the \"Upcoming Events\" section. Use\nthis screenshot to guide you. If you get\nstuck, go ahead and ask your partner. Never be afraid to ask! Hint: you might\nneed to create a container for the text pieces!\n\nLet's take a break from flexbox for a minute. Do you remember the :first-child\npsuedo class? There's a :last-child psuedo class as well.\n\nExercise: See if you can use these psuedo classes to give the left box a\ngrey background (#ddd) and the right box a grey border (1px solid #ddd).\nUse this screenshot to guide you.\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete the \"Common Responsive Patterns\" lesson of the\nResponsive Web Design Fundamentals\ncourse.\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete as many levels of the\nFlexbox Froggy game as you can. This will\nstretch your knowledge of Flexbox and you may need to do some research. It's\nok if you can't complete all levels. Do as many as you can.\n(Est. 3 hours) Complete as many levels as you can from\nFlexbox Zombies\n(Est. 2-3 hours) Continue working on the webpage you created in last week's\nhomework assignment. Add a sidebar to your site and move the site description\ninto it. When viewing on a small screen, this should appear below the\narticles. On a larger screen, it should switch to a two-column layout with\nthe articles and sidebar sitting side-by-side. Add at least three more\narticles and then convert them to a grid, so that you show 3 articles per row\nin a box layout.\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Flexbox is relatively new and is not supported in older\nbrowsers. In most of your work, you'll use Flexbox. But an employer might\nwant you to use one of the older layout strategies. Read this article to\nlearn about\npositioning content in CSS\nusing floats and absolute positioning.\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\n(Est. 1 hour) You may remember Bootstrap from your application process. Look\nat the documentation for Bootstrap 4\nand look at their examples to see how they are building components.\n\n"},"html-css/week-03/lesson.html":{"url":"html-css/week-03/lesson.html","title":"Week 3 - Design frameworks, Naming patterns and Forms","keywords":"","body":"HTML/CSS 3\nTo Be Agreed\n\n What we will learn today?\n\nDesign framework\nNaming patterns\nForms\n(Optional) CSS processors\n\n\nDesign frameworks\nA design framework is a collection of re-usable code snippets which you can use\nto build a website. It is sometimes called a \"design system\", \"style guide\", or\n\"pattern library\", and will usually consist of three things:\n\nBrand guidelines define the appropriate typography, colors and logos to\nuse.\nComponents define re-usable code snippets for common requirements, like\nnavigation menus.\nHelpers define additional code tools to construct the site, like layout\ngrids\n\nHaving a design framework is essential when working in large projects, as it\nallows developers to share code, without having to write the same thing several\ntimes. It also allows the core design elements to be changed easily. For\nexample, if all the buttons in your website use the same CSS class, you can\nchange their appearance simply by editing one rule.\nThe BBC's Global Experience Language is a design framework. It calls it's\ncomponents\ndesign patterns\nand in the\nfoundations section\nyou'll find discussion of layouts and typography.\nExamples of CSS frameworks\nLarger companies use design styleguides as a daily tool, allowing them to\ndeliver code faster and improve communication between designers and developers\n(which is not always easy!!).\n\nMailChimp >\nLonely planet >\nCodePen >\n\nOpen source frameworks\nWhen you need to create a website very quickly, in order to test a concept, for\nexample, there are design systems that you can use. In addition to CSS classes,\nthey also bring Javascript functionality that works out of the box (by applying\nCSS classes to your elements). Explore the documentation of the frameworks\nbelow.\n\nBootstrap >\nSkin >\nFoundation\n\nBootstrap is CSS and JavaScript code that we\nload in our HTML pages.\nBootstrap's documentation describes how to write HTML code that fits the\nBootstrap components, including a\ngrid layout as well as several\ncomponents.\n\nExercise: Explore the examples of CSS frameworks above. What do they have\nin common? What are the basic elements that all of the have?\nExercise: Go back to bikes-for-refugees and open index.html. Use the\nweb developer tools (\"Inspect Element\") to see which CSS classes are applied\nto each button (Donate now, Donate a bike today and Volunteer). How does\nthe Volunteer button differ from the other buttons?\nStill using the developer tools, change the height of the three buttons with\none line of code. Do the same for font-sizes.\nBikes-for-refugees already includes Bootstrap. Check its\ndocumentation > and add some elements to your\npage that use bootstrap. For example, a\nresponsive image >.\nExercise: Fork this repository and\nfollow the instructions in the readme\nto create a new page and add a card component to it.\nExercise: Perform a group exercise illustrating git branching and pull\nrequests. Then create a branch, commit your new page, and issue a pull\nrequest. Once all the pull requests are merged, switch back to the master\nbranch and update your copy.\n\nNaming Patterns\nWe use naming patterns to organise our code so that it is easier for colleagues\nto work with our code -- and easier for us to work with our colleagues' code. In\na team of developers, you will need to understand, read and make use of a naming\npattern.\nBootstrap uses a naming pattern called Object-Oriented CSS (OOCSS). The goal\nis to define an object, which is another word for a component, and come up\nwith a set of re-usable class names appropriate for that object.\n\n  You have successfully completed your task.\n\n\n  You did not complete your task.\n\n\n.alert {\n  padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem;\n  border-radius: 0.25em;\n}\n.alert-success {\n  background-color: green;\n}\n.alert-error {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n\n\nExercise: As a group, let's explore the naming patterns in Bootstrap's\nCard component.\nHow is the object-oriented naming pattern used here?\n\nLet's look at the following example of Bootstrap's Card component:\n\n  \n    Card title\n    Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n  \n\n\nWe have three types of class names here:\n\n.card is the object.\n.card-block, .card-title, and .card-text are sub-objects.\n.card-inverted is a modifier.\n\nWith Bootstrap's naming pattern, we know an object is a single word class name\nlike .card, .btn or .alert. But our other two types of class names share\nthe same naming pattern: .card-inverted and .card-block.\nThe Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) naming pattern is an attempt to overcome\nthis. It introduces separate naming structures for all three types of class\nnames.\n\nThe object is called a \"Block\": .card.\nThe sub-objects are called \"Elements\" and are written with 2\nunderscores: .card__block, .card__title and .card__text.\nThe modifier is written with 2 dashes as: .card--inverted.\n\nIf we changed our Card example to use BEM syntax, it would look like this:\n\n  \n    Card title\n    Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n  \n\n\n\n\"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and\nnaming things\" - Phil Karlton\n\nOne of the goals in a naming pattern is to communicate purpose.\nHTML Forms\nForms provide tools for visitors to your webpage to interact by entering\ndetails, making selections or performing other actions. When you write an update\non Facebook, you're entering a message into a form field, and \"posting\" that\nmessage to Facebook.\n\n\nExercise: Read this guide on\nHTML forms. Then add a form to your new\npage. The form should include fields for the user to write their name, email\naddress and a message. It should also include a button.\nExercise: Look at the documentation for\nBootstrap's form components.\nUpdate your form to use Bootstrap's form groups, form controls and buttons.\nWhen you're done, create a new branch, commit, and issue a pull request.\n\nCSS processors\nTwo of the most important principles of web development are to avoid\nrepetition and aim for reusability. CSS is a fairly simple language, which is\nperfect for small websites, but when left to its own devices ends up creating\ntoo much repetition.\nIn order to minimize this, we have tools called CSS processors. There are many,\nincluding SASS, LESS, PostCSS and also Javascript based ones. In this lesson, we\nwill learn about SASS.\nVariables\n$border-color: #262626;\n\n.primary-button {\n  border: $border-color 1px solid;\n}\n\ninput {\n  border: $border-color 2px dotted;\n}\n\nOutputs\n.primary-button {\n  border: #262626 1px solid;\n}\n\ninput {\n  border: #262626 2px dotted;\n}\n\nNesting\n.articles {\n  h1 {\n    font-size: 20px;\n  }\n\n  p {\n    margin-bottom: 30px;\n  }\n\n  .hero-image {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n}\n\nOutputs\n.articles h1 {\n  font-size: 20px;\n}\n\n.articles p {\n  margin-bottom: 30px;\n}\n\n.articles .hero-image {\n  width: 100%;\n}\n\nComposability\n.btn {\n  border-radius: 3px;\n\n  &--primary {\n    background-color: #802be2;\n  }\n\n  &--secondary {\n    background-color: #ffffff;\n  }\n}\n\nOutputs\n.btn {\n  border-radius: 3px;\n}\n\n.btn--primary {\n  background-color: #802be2;\n}\n\n.btn--secondary {\n  background-color: #ffffff;\n}\n\nConditions\nDo somehting based on a variable.\n$food: apple;\n\ndiv {\n  @if $food == apple {\n    background-color: red;\n  } @else if $food == pear {\n    color: green;\n  } @else {\n    color: grey;\n  }\n}\n\nOutputs\ndiv {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n\nThe background color is read because we defined the variable food as apple in\nthe beginning.\nLoops\n@for $i from 1 through 8 {\n  $width: percentage(1 / $i);\n\n  .col-#{$i} {\n    width: $width;\n  }\n}\n\nOutputs\n.col-1 {\n  width: 100%;\n}\n.col-2 {\n  width: 50%;\n}\n.col-3 {\n  width: 33.333%;\n}\n.col-4 {\n  width: 25%;\n}\n.col-5 {\n  width: 20%;\n}\n.col-6 {\n  width: 16.666%;\n}\n.col-7 {\n  width: 14.285%;\n}\n.col-8 {\n  width: 12.5%;\n}\n\nExample taken from here.\nHomework\n\nIf you haven't already, fork the\ncss-skin repository. If you\nhave already forked it, you can use your fork for this exercise. . Open\nindex.html and look at the images of how your buttons should look like, and\nthen notice the unstyled buttons above. . The unstyled buttons have classes.\nUse them to write your css in skin.css, so the buttons receive a style. Go\nfor maximum reusability. Try not to repeat code! . Add more HTML examples,\nfollowing the same naming pattern as the buttons - for example, a list (ul)\nwith items (li). Add more than one sytle of element (for example a ul\nthat displays the elements vertically and other that displays them\nhorizontally). . Write the CSS for those elements. . As usual, make a pull\nrequest and send them to one of the mentors for review!\nRead about\nwriting loops in SCSS >\n(Sass). Fork this CodePen into your account:\nhttps://codepen.io/claudiamm/pen/xdjadV. You have three paragraphs, each with\na different paragraph-size class. First, write the common styles (color,\netc) for all paragraphs. Use a SASS for loop and nesting in order to create\nthe paragraph-size-1/2/3 styles. The final result should look like this:\n\n\nNote: the aim of this exercise is to do a for loop - so please do NOT do\nsomething like below, as it will not bring you anything new:\n.paragraph-size-1 {\n  ...;\n}\n.paragraph-size-2 {\n  ...;\n}\n.paragraph-size-3 {\n  ...;\n}\n\nTip: you can multiply! $i * 10px;\n\n(Optional) Use SASS in your css-skin project instead of normal CSS.\nSuggestion: alongside skin.css, create a file called skin.scss.

This is the first thing we'll do in JavaScript, using\nsomething called a console.log().\nconsole.log()\nWhen we ran the command node main.js - that did log to the console\nprinting the words Hello World to the terminal.\nLet's open the file main.js and investigate its contents\n\nExercises\n\nWhat do you notice about the code? Anything you don't understand? Notice the\nsemicolon, the dot, the parantheses - these are all elements of JavaScript\nSyntax\n\nTry to console.log() something different, for example, Hello World. I\njust started learning JavaScript!. (run node main.js after each change\nand look at the output in the console)\n\nTry to console.log() several things at once.\nWhat happens when you get rid of the quote marks?\nWhat happens when you console.log() just a number without quotes?\n\n\nComments\nYou can put comments to help you and others understand your code - use // to\nadd a comment (or if it is a multi-line comment, then use /* and */ around\nyour comment)\n// This is a comment for myself and other developers to understand the next line of code\nconsole.log(\"Hello world!\");\n\nconsole.log(\"Hello World\"); // comments can also be in the same line like this\n/*\nI can also make comments\nover more than one line if necessary\n*/\nconsole.log(\"Hello World\");\n\n\nExercises What are the comments in that main.js script.\n\nNode\nWe ran our JavaScript using Node - Node is is an open-source, cross-platform\nJavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nWikipedia\n\nExercises What are other \"places\" where we can run JavaScript code?\n\nData Types\nIf you played around with console.log() in the last step, you might have\nnoticed that words always have to be inside quotes or else the code breaks,\nwhereas numbers can work without quotes. Why is this? Well these are different\ndata types in JavaScript. You'll need to learn the three main data types to\nget started coding (later we'll look at some other data types, like objects and\narrays).\nStrings\nStrings are simple text, ranging anywhere from a single character to lengthy\nparagraphs. A string is always written inside a pair of quotes (single or\ndouble).\n\"node girls\";\n\nNumbers\nNumbers do not need to be wrapped in quotes like strings, and can just be\nwritten as is.\n100; // an integer number\n100.89; // a decimal number (floating point)\n\nBooleans\nThere is a special data type in JavaScript known as a \"boolean\" value. A boolean\nis either true or false, and it should be written without quotes.\ntrue;\n\nYou've seen what they look like, now make sure they are what you think they are.\nThere is a built-in feature in JavaScript which allows you to check the type of\na particular value: typeof.\nWrite this code in your main.js, and run it (using node main.js in the\nterminal):\nconsole.log(typeof \"Hello world!\");\n\nYou should see string printed to the console.\n\nExercise Now try that three times, once for each data type. Log the\ntypeof for three different values: \"Code Your Future\", 6 and false.\nYou should get different output for each one.\n\nVariables\nWhen you code, you'll want to create shortcuts so you can easily refer to\nthings without writing out the same value every time. In JavaScript we have\nvariables, which allow us to store values to use later.\n\nThink of variables names like labels on boxes, while the value of the\nvariable are the contents of the box - you could change the contents of a\nbox and leave the label intact, the contents of the boxes can have different\ntypes, the boxes should have good labels (a box of books being labeled pens\nwould be very confusing),\n\nPhoto from\nKhan Academy\n\nTry it out\nYou create a variable using the keyword var, which lets the application know\nthat you're about to store a value. You also have to give a name to your\nvariable, which can be anything you like, so long as it doesn't include spaces.\nHere's an example of creating a variable called \"city\", which is storing a\nstring called \"Glasgow\".\nvar city = \"Glasgow\";\nconsole.log(city);\n\nYou'll notice that once you've created the variable, you can then simply write\nthe name of the variable wherever you want to refer to it, rather than writing\nout Glasgow every time. You don't put quotes around a variable name.\nTry to run the above code, and see what is printed to the console.\n\nExercise\nIn the above example, what will happen if we change the second line to\nconsole.log(\"city\") - Do you notice the difference? What do you think will\nbe the output?\n\nYou should have some code left over from previous steps which looks something\nlike this (maybe even with comments):\nconsole.log(typeof \"Code Your Future\");\nconsole.log(typeof 6);\nconsole.log(typeof false);\n\n\nExercise: Now that you know how to create variables, rewrite this code.\nThis time, define these values as variables at the top of the file, create a\nvariable called courseName and assign it the value Code Your\nFuture. Then create a variable called courseDuration and assign it the value\n6, and a variable called isHard and assign it the value false.\nRefer to the three variables that you just created to get their types (i.e.\nconsole.log(typeof courseName) etc...)\nIs your output the same?\n\nConditionals\nNow we're going to start adding in some logic. So far we have been logging\nthe same thing every time we run the code, but what if we want to log according\nto different conditions? In programming there is something called an \"if/else\nstatement\". It tests conditions, and will perform different actions based on the\noutcome of these tests.\nThe structure of an if/else statement in JavaScript is as follows:\nif (condition) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nIt basically translates to \"if this condition is true, do this - or else do\nsomething else\".\nTry it out\nWhat if we want to console.log() \"Hello world!\" if we're feeling happy, and\nsomething else if we're sad?\nLet's define a variable called isHappy, and assign it a boolean value of\ntrue or false (depending on how happy you're feeling).\nvar isHappy = true;\n\nThen let's write our if/else statement. In our condition, we want to test if the\nvariable isHappy is equal to true. Note that in JavaScript, to test if two\nthings are equal you need to use a triple equals (===) rather than just one\n(=).\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nNow let's add in what will happen if the conditions are met. The comments are\nthere to explain what is happening.\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // if I am happy, print \"Hello world!\"\n  console.log(\"Hello world!\");\n} else {\n  // if I am sad, print a frowny face\n  console.log(\":(\");\n}\n\nNow run this code and see what happens! Try changing the value of your variable\nfrom true to false.\n\nExercise\nWrite an if/else statement that evaluates if a number is even or odd. If it is\neven, it will print the string 'even', and if it is odd, it will print\n'odd'.\nFor this challenge, you might find it useful to use the \"modulo\" operator,\nwhich looks like this: %. The modulo operator finds the remainder after\ndivision of one number by another. For example:\n13 % 2 === 1; // 13 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1\n100 % 10 === 0; // 100 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 0\n\nExercise\nNow improve your code so that it prints out if the number is positive or\nnegative, as well as even or odd. For example, for -5 it will print\n'negative odd', while for 4 it will print 'positive even'.\nHint: You can use the > or  signs.\nIf you finish early, think about how you would test your code works correctly?\n\nLoops\nCoding is great because it makes it easy to automate boring tasks, like writing\nthe same thing over and over again. A \"for loop\" lets you do that in\nJavaScript. \"For loops\" let you perform the same operation a certain number of\ntimes, each time with a different value.\nA for loop has the following syntax:\nfor (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nStatement 1 defines a variable for the loop and assigns it a starting value.\nIt is usually a number, which will increase each time the loop completes an\niteration. We can use this number inside the loop to keep track of where we're\nat. You can set the number to be whatever you want initially.\nvar i = 0;\n\nStatement 2 defines how long the loop will go on for (what needs to happen\nfor the loop to stop running?). It most often uses the less than () or less\nthan or equal to () operators to set the length.\ni \nStatement 3 defines by how much to increment the i variable each time the\nloop completes an iteration. If you just want it to increase by one, then put\ni++, or else you can increase by other numbers like so:\ni += 2;\n\nInside the square brackets goes the code you wish to be executed each time the\nloop runs. You can refer to the variable i from inside the loop.\nTry it out\nHere's an example of an actual for loop that prints out the numbers 1 to 10:\nfor (var i = 1; i \nNotice the variable i is set to 1, because we want counting to begin there.\nThe length is set to be less than or equal to 10, as we want the loop to end\nthere. And we are increasing the value of i by one each time.\n\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that loops over the numbers from 1 to 100, printing only\nevery second number. So it should return 2, 4, 6, 8, 10....\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that prints out all the numbers between 1 and 100 divisble by\n5.\nSee if you can think or more than one way to solve this.\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that prints out the sum of all the numbers between 1 and 100.\n\nFunctions\nWe've been writing code that performs different actions, but sometimes you want\nto group code together to achieve a particular end. This is where functions come\nin.\nA function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A function\nis executed when it is \"invoked\".\nThe syntax of a function looks like this:\nfunction functionName(parameters) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nYou can call a function whatever you want, just like a variable. You can also\ngive a function different values every time you run it which are called\n\"parameters\".\nTo make the function run, we invoke it like so:\nfunctionName();\n\nTry it out\nLet's write a function that adds two numbers together. We'll call it add. We\nwant to add together two different numbers every time, so let's define two\nparameters to represent this, x and y.\nfunction add(x, y) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nadd(2, 3);\n\nNotice I've invoked the function underneath, with the paremeters 2 and 3.\nInside the function, try to console.log() your parameters and see what\nhappens.\nNow, we want to add these two numbers together, but it isn't enough just to\nwrite x + y, since we haven't told the function to return anything. It's time\nfor a return statement. The return statement specifies the value to output.\nfunction add(x, y) {\n  return x + y;\n}\nadd(2, 3);\n\nRun this code, and hopefully you get the right answer!\n\nExercise\nWrite a function called multiply that multiplies two numbers together. It\nshould take two numbers as parameters and return the answer.\nExercise\nGo back and copy the code to your previous solution for printing the sum of\nnumbers between 1 and 100. Put this code inside a function. Change the\nfunction so it accepts any two limits and prints the sum of all the numbers\nbetween those limits.\nFor example: addBetween(1,3) should print 6\n\nResources\n\nData Types\nComparison Operators\nArithmetic Operators\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo that you\nhave forked during this class contains few challenges - solve them in\nJavaScript!\n\nFollow\nthis course\non Khan Academy.

Arrays are to the rescue!\nImagine an array like a list or a collection of variables, but instead of each\nvariable having its own name, only the array has a name. So how do you access a\nvariable inside, then? How do you read and write? Using an index!\nAn index is just a whole number, such as 0, 1, 2 and so forth. As in many\nareas of computing, indices in JavaScript arrays start with 0 --- so 0 is\nthe index of the first element of an Array, 1 is the index of the second\nelement, and so forth.\nThe syntax is to list the values separated by commas, inside square brackets:\n[value1, value2, value3];\n\nYou can store any type of value inside an array: strings, numbers, booleans. You\ncan even store other arrays, or objects (which you will learn about next).\nTry it out\nDefining an array as a variable looks something like this:\nvar animals = [\"tiger\", \"puppy\", \"snake\", \"llama\"];\n\nPretty neat! Now you have all the animals grouped together rather than having to\ndefine them separately. You can see how many animals there are by using\n.length:\nconsole.log(animals.length);\n\nIf you want to refer to one specific member of the array, you can do so by using\ntheir \"index number\" like so.\nconsole.log(animals[1]);\n\n\nTake a guess at which animal that will print out, and see if you're right.\n\nSpoiler alert, it will print out \"puppy\". That might seem weird, until you learn\nthat JavaScript is a \"0-index\" language. What that means is that counting in\nJavaScript starts at 0. So animals[0]will print out \"tiger\". We don't make the\nrules...\n\nExercise:\n\nCreate an array that contains the countries of all the students in the\nclass (at least five nationalities)\nconsole.log the number of countries in the Array\nNow, console.log() each country in the list. Hint: For loops\n\nDon't ask a mentor - Google it! Try googling to find the answer if you're\nstuck. Google skills are an essential part of being a developer.\n\nObjects\nNow for the final data type: objects. Like arrays, they can store multiple bits\nof information, except objects store the properties of something. For example,\nyou might want to save the name, model and colour of a car. Or the name, time\nand location of a film playing at the cinema.\nThe syntax looks like this:\n{\n  property1: \"value1\",\n  property2: \"value2\",\n  property3: \"value3\"\n}\n\nThe names on the left (\"property1\") are known \"keys\". Any values can be given to\nthem: strings, booleans, integers.\nTry it out\nLet's define an object that represents a person:\nvar person = {\n  firstName: \"Nelson\",\n  lastName: \"Mandela\",\n  occupation: \"freedom fighter\",\n  age: 95,\n  alive: false\n};\n\nWe can console.log() the entire object, but you can also reference just one of\nthe properties. Run this code:\nconsole.log(person.firstName);\n\n\nExercise Using an object representing a person, console.log() a sentence\nintroducing the person. Print out the following:\n\"Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName}. I am {age} years old, and work as a\n{occupation}.\"\nHint: you can construct longer strings by adding them together. This includes\nvariables. For example:\nvar name = \"Jane\";\nconsole.log(\"People call me \" + name);\n\n// the previous line will print\n// \"People call me Jane\"\n\n\nUseful array methods\nConcatenating two arrays\nYou've learned how you can add two numbers and append two strings, but how does\nthis work for arrays? A simple arr1 + arr2 will not do, but there is a method\nyou can use: concat(). It is a method that you call on the array (similar to\nhow console.log is the log function called on console) and takes the array\nyou want to append as a parameter.\nvar countries = [\"Scotland\", \"Germany\", \"Syria\"];\nvar moreCountries = [\"Sudan\", \"Ethiopia\", \"France\"];\n\ncountries.concat(moreCountries);\nconsole.log(countries); // ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria', 'Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France']\n\nAppending an element\nIf you want to append an element to an array, you can just put it after the last\nexisting element like so:\ncountries[countries.length] = \"United States of America\";\n\nThere is another way though, which is a bit more elegant: the push function.\ncountries.push(\"United States of America\");\n\n// .push can also be called with multiple parameters\ncountries.push(\"United States of America\", \"France\");\n\n\nExercise: Search .slice, .splice and .pop and tell us what they do\n\nResources\n\nArrays\nObjects\nStrings\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo that you\nhave forked during the last class contains few challenges - solve them all in\nJavaScript.

So when do you use an\nArray and when do you use an Object.\n\n\"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data\nstructures and their relationships.\" Linus Torvalds\nLet's talk about the differences between Arrays and Objects - when can you use\nor the other. As a general rule of thumb:\n\n\nDoes the order of data matter? Then use Arrays.\nCan the data be organised by a label? Then use Objects.\n\n\nExercise: Let's say we're writing a program to model and display a Newspaper:\nwhat data structure would you use to model the different sections of the\nnewspaper (sports, politics etc..)?

Tip: have a think about if you could re-use a function from a\nprevious example...\n\n\n\nValue vs Reference Types\nA variable can hold two types of values: primitives (value types) and reference\ntypes. The distinction between them is very important and will be a fundamental\naddition to your JavaScript arsenal.\nPrimitives are:\n\nstring (example: John Doe)\nnumber (example: 100)\nboolean (example: true or false)\n\nReference types are:\n\nObjects (example: {greeting: \"hello\"})\nArrays (example: [1,2,3])\nFunctions (example: function doNothing() { })\n\nVariables can only hold a few bytes of data. Because primitives have fixed\nsizes, when you assign a primitive to a variable, it will hold the actual value\nof the primitive (hence the name \"value type\"). But reference types can have\npractically infinite sizes, so when you assign a reference type to a variable,\nthat variable will hold a reference to it only: an identifier which will tell\nour program where to look for that object in memory.\n\nPass by value / reference\nConsider the example below.\n``js\nfunction addFive(value) { value = value + 5; }\nvar ten = 10; addFive(ten); console.log(ten);\nWe have a function that accepts a value as an argument. The function then adds five to the\nargument and logs the value.\nAfter invoking the function with the variable `ten`, the variable is logged.\n\nWhat will be the values logged?\nAnswer: 10 (not 15)\n\nExplanation:\nIn JavaScript, variables are always passed to function by value. That means only the value\nthe variables was holding is passed to the function, and not a reference to the variable's\nlocation in memory. That means that inside a function call, any changes we make to its\narguments will only apply inside the function (as seen in the previous example).\n\n**Be careful though**, as the value of an argument might be a reference to a JavaScript\nobject, in which case, changing a property on that object will also reflect everywhere\nelse we use a reference to that object.\n\nFor example:\n\n``js\n\nfunction a(primitive, object) {\n    primitive = primitive + 5;\n    object.greeting = \"how are you?\";\n    object = {\n      greeting: \"holla!\"\n    };\n}\nvar primitive = 10;\nvar object = {\n  greeting: 'hello'\n};\na(primitive, object);\nconsole.log(primitive); // 10\nconsole.log(object.greeting); // \"how are you?\"\n\nLet's look at the illustrations here:\nhttp://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-primitive-vs-reference-values/ to\nunderstand this behavior better\nExercise\n\nOpen up the\nCodePen here\nCreate a new index.html and main.js file\nLink the main.js from the index.html so that it runs in the browser\nCopy the exercises from the CodePen above into main.js and follow the\ninstructions in the comments\n\n\nScope\nBefore we get into what scope is, let's try a little exercise.\nOpen up jsbin and write the following:\nfunction () {\n    var name = \"hello\";\n}\nconsole.log(name);\n\n\nWhat do you think the first console.log will print?\n\nvar hello = \"outer\";\nfunction() {\n    var hello = \"inner\";\n    console.log(hello);\n}\n\n\nWhat do you think calling the function will print?\n\nLet's see another example\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n  var a = 10;\n\n  var secondFunction = function() {\n    console.log(a);\n  };\n\n  secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nThis should work fine, and the console should print 10. But what if we swap\nthe positions of var a and the console.log()?\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n  console.log(a);\n\n  var secondFunction = function() {\n    var a = 10;\n  };\n\n  secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nThis returns an error: ReferenceError: a is not defined. You might think that\nthe problem is that we're trying to console log a before it's declared in the\ncode order. So let's try putting the console.log(a) after secondFunction,\nwhere a is assigned:\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n  var secondFunction = function() {\n    var a = 10;\n  };\n\n  console.log(a);\n\n  secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nWait, we're still getting the ReferenceError! Even if we move the\nconsole.log(a) underneath where secondFunction is called, we still get the\nerror. What's going on?\nWhat we're seeing here is the effect of scope. Take a look at the following\ndiagram:\n\nWe can see from this picture that each function is like a 'bubble', and it has\naccess to the variable assigned within it, and the variables assigned 'above'\nit, in it's surrounding function. But note that the 'global' scope doesn't have\naccess to var o, and function outer() doesn't have access to var i. So\neach function can access the variables in its parent scope, and in it's\nown, immediate scope, but it cannot see the variables in its child\nscope.\nIf a variable is declared outside of a function, in the 'window', it has\n'global' scope. The scope within a function is 'local' scope:\nvar test = \"I'm global\";\n\nfunction testScope() {\n  var test = \"I'm local\";\n  console.log(test);\n}\n\ntestScope(); // output: I'm local\n\nconsole.log(test); // output: I'm global\n\n\nExercise\n\nContinue working on your main.js from your previous exercises\nCopy the exercises from this\nCodePen\nRemember to comment/uncomment each set once you're done with them\n\n\nResources\n\nObjects vs Arrays -\nhttps://www.metaltoad.com/blog/javascript-understanding-objects-vs-arrays-and-when-use-them-part-1\nJavaScript Arrays and Objects Are Just Like Books and Newspapers\nhttps://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-arrays-and-objects-are-just-like-books-and-newspapers-6e1cbd8a1746\n\nHomework\n\nCreate an account on CodeWars and do at least 15\nchallenges.\nSign up for the JavaScript 30 course and do at\nleast 2 project.

Every array has access to these methods (because Arrays are created by\nthe Array constructor function they inherit the the properties of\nArray.prototype).\nOf particular use are the Array methods that enable you to iterate over an\narray. We've covered iteration already when we learnt how to use for loops.\nWell, I have some amazing news for you - you will probably never need to write a\nfor loop again!\nLet's take a look at Array.prototype.forEach first. This is pretty much a\nstraight replacement for for loops.\nvar myArr = [1, 2, 3];\n\nmyArr.forEach(function(item) {\n  console.log(item);\n});\n\n// 1\n// 2\n// 3\n\nOOOOF! Wasn't that glorious?! Much nicer than writing a for loop! So how\nexactly does this work? forEach iterates over each item the array. For each\nitem is calls a function - the one that was provided as an parameter to\nforEach.\nCallback functions\nFunctions that are provided as parameters to another function are called\ncallback functions. Often we will write these functions inside the function\ncall like did in the forEach example, but we can also pass in reference to an\nalready defined function:\nfunction callback(item) {\n  console.log(item);\n}\n\nmyArr.forEach(callback);\n\nWhether you define your function beforehand or write it straight into the\nfunction call will depend on whether you intend on re-using that callback again.\n\nExercise\nLet's create a function called average that receives an array of numbers.\nImplement the function using a forEach method calculate the average of all\nnumbers passed in and return it.\n\nMore array methods\nPreviously we've used for loops to create new versions of an array doing\nsomething like this:\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\nvar newArr = [];\n\nfor (var i = 0; i \nThere are several methods on Array.prototype that can be used for this sort of\ntask.\nThe most popular method is .map(), which does the following:\n\niterates over the array it is called on\ncalls a callback function on every iteration\npasses in the current array item and its index to the callback function\nuses the returned value from the callback function to populate a new array\nreturns the new array\n\nThat sounds like a lot but once you use .map() a few times it'll begin to feel\nmore intuitive. Let's try it and see if we can refactor the for loop example:\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\nvar newArr = arr.map(function(num) {\n  return num + 1;\n});\nconsole.log(newArr); // [2,3,4]\n\nAnother useful array method is .filter(). It works in a similar way to map\nexcept that rather than return a value in the callback function, you return\ntrue or false depending on whether you want the current item to be included\nin the new array. Returning true means that you want to keep the item,\nreturning false means it should be omitted.\nLet's create a new array with only numbers greater than 5:\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];\nvar newArr = arr.filter(function(num) {\n  return arr > 5;\n});\nconsole.log(newArr); // [5,6,7,8,9]\n\n\nRemember: Most array methods do not change the current array, they return a\nnew array. Check the MDN documentation for the array method if you are not\nsure about this.\n\nChaining methods\nIf we want to apply more than one array method to an array we might try\nsomething like this, creating an intermediate variable after each\ntransformation.\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\nvar arrMapped = arr.map(function(num) {\n  return num + 1;\n});\nvar arrFiltered = newArr.filter(function(num) {\n  return num > 5;\n});\n\nThis can get quite awkward though, especially when you have to think of a\nvariable name for each stage. Thankfully there is a much simpler way. We can\nchain methods together:\nvar newArr = [1,2,3]\n  .map(function (num) {\n    return num + 1;\n  });\n  .filter(function (num) {\n    return num > 5;\n  });\n\nThere's nothing magical happening here. This works because:\n\nthe array methods are returning new arrays\nevery array has access to all the array methods on Array.prototype\n\nAs soon as an array is returned by an array method we can call another array\nmethod on the return value.\n\nExercise\nTransform the following array [4,5,3,6,7,8,9,1,2] by 1) sorting it, 2)\ndoubling each number, and 3) filtering numbers less than 10 Write named\nfunctions that can be used as callbacks.\n\nHomework\n\nSubmit a PR and pass all the functions for the\nunit-testing-london\nrepository\n\nLook at each other's Pull Requests and leave feedback\n\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nRead:\nDocument Object Model (DOM)\n\nRead:\nCallback function\n\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html","title":"Week 8 - DOM, Events","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core: in the Browser\n\n What we will learn today?\n\nDOM\nEvents\n\n\nThe DOM\nYour webpages are made up of a bunch of HTML elements, nested within each other\n(parents and children). In JavaScript we have access to this \"DOM\" object\n(Document Object Model) which is actually a representation of our webpage that\nJavaScript can work with.\nIn the browser the DOM is represented by the window.document object, which can\nalso be accessed directly using document. We can use it to get information\nabout the page loaded into the browser, query the content of the page and edit\nit. You can see full details of the functionality\nhere.\nQuerying\nThe DOM offers a lot of useful functions we can use to find elements on the\npage. Here are some we'll be using today:\n// gets an Element with id 'submit'\nvar element = document.getElementById(\"submit\");\n\ngetElementById accepts an id string as argument and returns an Element from\nthe document with a matching id. If no matching Element is found the function\nreturns null.\n// get an HTMLCollection containing elements with class 'link'\nvar links = document.getElementsByClassName(\"link\");\n\ngetElementsByClassName takes a string containing one or more classes and\nreturns an HTMLCollection, which is an array-like object containing all\nelements whose class attributes match the string. We can pass multiple classes\nas an argument to query for elements matching all classes.\n// get an Element with id 'submit'\nvar form = document.getElementById(\"myform\");\n// get an HTMLCollection containing elements with class 'red'\n// which are children of the 'form' element\nvar inputs = form.getElementsByClassName(\"red\");\n\ngetElementsByClassName can be called on individual elements as well as the\ntop-level document object. When calling getElementsByClassName on an\nelement, the method will query only the children of the element rather than\nthe entire document\nvar elements = document.getElementsByTagName(\"div\"); // or:\nvar elements = someElement.getElementsByTagName(\"a\");\n\nMuch like getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName allows us to query\nfor elements using the tag name. getElementsByTagName also returns\nHTMLCollection and can be called on elements as well as document.\nAll of the above calls return a live reference, which means that the objects\nwill be automatically updated with all changes since the query.\n\nExercise:\n\nClone the repo from HTML and CSS class into new bikes directory. git\nclone git@github.com:dmitrigrabov/bikes-for-refugees.git bikes\nOnce cloned run npm install to download the dependencies:\nImplement getTitle, getNumberOfBikes, getAllButtonText,\ngetNavLinksText in src/functions.js using above methods to get all tests\npassing using npm test:\n\n\nQuery selector\nThe above selector functions are available in all browsers, but can be somewhat\ninflexible for example in situations that require complex lookups. Modern\nbrowsers have\ndocument.querySelector(\"#mainHeader\");\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"p\");\n\nBoth .querySelector and querySelectorAll accept a CSS selector as an input.\n.querySelector selects only the first element it finds, querySelectorAll\nselects all elements and returns a NodeList, which is a collection of Nodes\n(not an array). Unlike the selectors in the previous section, these functions\nreturn static results. That means any changes in the DOM will NOT result in\nupdates to the elements.\n\nExercise:\n\nRewrite solutions to previous exercise using querySelector and\nquerySelectorAll. You may need to look up documentation for NodeList.\n\n\nDOM manipulation\nWe can use the DOM to edit elements. For example the textContent property of\nelements can used to read as well as set the text contents of an element.\nvar x = document.querySelector(\".jumbotron h1\");\nconsole.log(x.textContent); // Bikes for Refugees\nx.textContent = \"Something else\";\n\nSimilarly, innerHTML property of elements can be used to get the HTML content\nof an element as well as\nvar x = document.querySelector(\".jumbotron h1\");\nx.innerHTML = \"\" + x.textContent + \"\";\n\nWe can also access the style property of elements and update various\nproperties\nvar elements = document.querySelectorAll(\".btn-primary\");\n\nelements.forEach(function(element) {\n  element.style.backgroundColor = \"red\";\n});\n\nPlease note the use of camelCase style attribute names\nWe can also check it exists, read, change and remove attributes of elements\nusing hasAttribute, getAttribute(), removeAttribute and setAttribute\nvar elements = document.querySelectorAll(\"a\");\n\nelements.forEach(element => {\n  if (element.hasAttribute(\"href\")) {\n    var href = element.getAttribute(\"href\");\n    element.setAttribute(\"href\", \"https://google.com\");\n  }\n});\n\nWhat will above code do?\n\nExercise:\n\nUse above functions to\n... place - around the text in the navbar links\n... convert links in 'Upcoming Events' section to italic using  tag\n... make Learn more links green\nEnsure all tests for above pass\n\n\nCreating and inserting elements\nWe can use document.createElement(tagName) method to create a new element and\ndocument.createTextNode(text) to create new text contents. The elements\ncreated can be manipulated just like the elements above, but the changes will\nnot be visible until we insert the new element into the DOM.\nWe can insert elements into other elements using element.appendChild or\nelement.insertBefore. For example.\n\n  some content\n\n\nvar spanNode = document.createElement(\"span\");\nvar textNode = document.createTextNode(\"hello\");\nspanNode.appendChild(textNode);\n\nvar parentNode = document.getElementById(\"parent\");\nparentNode.appendChild(spanNode);\n\nWhat do you think above code will do?\ninsertBefore is a bit more complicated.\nvar insertedNode = parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode);\n\nHere insertedNode is the the node being inserted, that is newNode.\nparentNode is the the parent of the newly inserted node. newNode is the node\nto be inserted and referenceNode is the node before which newNode is inserted.\n\nExercise:\n\nUse the inspector to examine the navbar\nUsing createElement etc. create a new navbar item link 'Code Your Future'\nwhich links to https://codeyourfuture.io/. It should have same structure\nas the other links\nInsert it at the end of the navbar\nEnsure all tests for above pass\n\n\nResources\n\nDOM: Document\nMDN: DOM Examples and explanation\n\nBrowser events\nBrowser events are actions that take place on our web page. They could be user\ntriggered such as a mouse being clicked, a key being pressed or a form\nsubmitted. Alternatively, they could be triggered by the system such as a\nresource being loaded or an error occurring.\nWe can subscribe to those events by registering an eventHandler to perform a\ncertain action when an event is detected. For example, we may want to update a\nletter count on a text input when a user types or we may want to perform\nvalidation on a form before submitting it.\nFor each event subscription we will need 3 things:\n\ntarget - this is the object where we are listening for events on. For\nexample, it could be a link on which we would like to listen to for clicks.\neventType - as the name suggests, this is the type of event we ar listening\nfor. There are dozens of possible events (see\nhere for the full\nlist). Common ones include . click - mouse click . submit - form submit .\nkeydown - keyboard key being pressed . mouseenter - a mouse cursor being\nmoved onto an element . change - value of a form input changing\neventHandler - A function that we want to execute when the event is\ndetected\n\nTo subscribe to the actual event we use the addEventListener method of our\ntarget element like below\nvar myButton = document.querySelector(\"#myButton\");\nmyButton.addEventListener(\"click\", alertSomething);\n\nfunction alertSomething() {\n  alert(\"Something\");\n}\n\nIn the above code myButton is the target on which we listen to for click\nevents and call the event handler alertSomething when the click is detected.\n\nExercise:\n\nSet a click listener on the donate buttons and increment the donated bikes\ncounter with each click ( no tests )\n\n\nEvent object\nJust knowing that an event has happened is not particularly useful in most\ncases. Usually, we will want to know more about what exactly happened such as\nthe coordinates of a mouse click or the new value of an input after it has\nchanged.\nKeep in mind that different event types will have characteristics that are\nspecific to them. For example, key events will have a event.char property\nindicating the key that was pressed. mouse events will have event.clientX\nand event.clientY properties indicating the location of the mouse event on the\nscreen, where (0,0) is the top left hand corner in the browser.\nEvery event object has a .preventDefault() which when called will prevent\nthe default action of the event from being triggered. This is particularly\nuseful to intercepting events and altering the behaviour when needed. For\nexample, we can call event.preventDefault() on a submit event if the data in\nthe form is not valid.\nWe can find out which element the event was triggered on from the event.target\nproperty.\n\nExercise:\n\nPrevent clicks on links from triggering a url change in the browser and\ninstead console.log the coordinates of the click as well as the text\ninside the link\n\n\nBubbling\n\nTogether:\n\nLet's place a click listener on the .jumbotron element and console.log\nthe event\nWhat happens when we click on the buttons?\n\n\nMost events, though not all, have a default behaviour know as bubbling which\nresults in events being propagated to the target element's parents. That means\nan event listener placed on the parent will be triggered after the event\nlistener placed on the child. Why is this behaviour desired?\nWe can distinguish between the elements on which the event was triggered vs the\nelement on which the event was detected.\n\nevent.target is the element on which received the initial event\nevent.currentTarget is the element on which the event listener detected the\nevent\n\nIn some cases we may want to prevent an event from bubbling up. We can do so by\ncalling the stopPropagation method on the event. Once it has been called, any\nevent handlers placed by parent elements will not be triggered.\n\nTogether:\n\nLet's prevent clicks on 'Volunteer' button from bubbling up to above\nlistener using stopPropagation\n\n\nResources\n\nIntroduction to browser events\nEvents\n\nHomework\n\nFork\nbookshelf-project.\nOpen up readme.md and follow the instructions in there.

For these type of functions, the callback is called once another function has completed. This allows you to run some other code while you're waiting for something to finish.\nfunction finished() {\n  console.log(\"The task has finished\");\n}\n\nfunction thingThatTakesALongTime(callback) {\n  //... Task that takes a long time to complete\n\n  callback(); // This is where the 'console.log' happens\n}\n\n// Pass the function to 'thingThatTakesALongTime' just like a normal variable\nthingThatTakesALongTime(finished);\n\nSo far all of the callbacks you have been using have been synchronous. This means your code is executed one line at a time, at the same time, in order. Asynchronous code is not executed in order, and can run at any time, in any order.\nAn example of this in real life, are phone calls and text messages.\n\nPhone calls are synchronous because you can't (really) do anything while the\nother person is speaking. You are always waiting for your turn to respond\nText messages are asynchronous. When you send a text, you can go away and do\nsomething else, until the other person responds.\n\nA simple example of an asynchronous function is setTimeout. This allows you to run a function after a\ngiven time period. The first argument is the function you want to run, the\nsecond argument is the delay (in milliseconds)\n// Separate function definition\nfunction myCallbackFunction() {\n  console.log(\"Hello world!\");\n}\nsetTimeout(myCallbackFunction, 1000);\n\n// Inline function\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  console.log(\"Goodbye world!\");\n}, 500);\n\n\nExercises\n\nUsing setTimeout, change the background color of the page after 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds).\nUpdate your code to make the color change every 5 seconds to something different. Hint: try searching for setInterval.\n\n\n\nPromises\nPromises are a new(ish) feature of JavaScript. They allow for\nwriting easier to understand code when dealing with asynchronous functions.\n\nPromises are more \"abstract\" than anything we have covered so far. They are a data structure that represents some result that is going to happen in the future. The result starts off as being unknown (pending) as the code has not completed yet. The result can then move to be successful (fulfilled) or failed (rejected).\nThe API is very simple. When you have a Promise, you can attach a .then\nmethod with a callback and/or a .catch method with a callback. If the promise is successful, then the function\nin the .then callback is called. If it fails, then the .catch callback is\ncalled.\n// Call a function that returns a Promise\nvar myPromise = functionThatReturnsAPromise();\n\nmyPromise.then(function(value) {\n  console.log(\"success: \" + value);\n});\n\nmyPromise.catch(function(value) {\n  console.log(\"fail:\" + value);\n});\n\nThe .then and .catch methods can be chained, like with Array methods:\nmyPromise.then(function(value) {\n  console.log(\"success: \" + value);\n})\n.catch(function(value) {\n  console.log(\"fail: \" + value);\n})\n\nYou can even return a Promise from within a .then callback, and keep chaining on more .then callbacks. This allows you to process part of the value and keep passing it along the chain:\n// myPromise resolves with a value of 50\nmyPromise.then(function(value) {\n  console.log(value) // Logs: 50\n  return Promise.resolve(value + 50); // Returns a new Promise\n})\n.then(function(value) {\n  console.log(value) // Logs: 100\n})\n\nWe will look at some common functions that return a Promise in a bit, but you can also create your own Promise. This example shows a Promise being \"resolved\" (successful):\nvar myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // Do some work in this function\n  resolve(100); // Resolves the Promise with the value 100\n});\n\nThis example shows a Promise being \"rejected\" (failed):\nvar myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // Do some work in this function\n  reject(50) // Rejects the Promise with the value 50\n});\n\n\nExercises\nComplete the exercises in this CodePen\n\nAJAX\nWhat's a server?\nA device or program that provides functionality to other programs or\ndevices. There are database servers, mail servers, game servers, etc. The vast majority of these servers are accessed over the internet.\nThey can take the form of industrial server farms that provide a service to\nmillions of users (used by Facebook, Google, etc.), to personal servers for\nstoring your files.\nThe server communicates with clients. Clients can be a web browser, a Slack\napp, your phone, etc.\nClient–server systems use the request–response model: a client sends a\nrequest to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to\nthe client, typically with a result or acknowledgement.\n\nAn example: We can use the Slack app (the client) to put our messages or\npictures on Slack. The content is stored on the Slack servers and other\nclients can then also access the pictures.\n\nHTTP requests\nA server stores the data, and the client (other programs or computers) requests\ndata or sends some of its own. But how do they talk to each other?\nFor the client and the server to communicate they need an established language\n(a protocol). Which is what HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is for. It\ndefines the methods you can use to communicate with a server and indicate your\ndesired actions on the resources of the server.\nThere are two main types of requests: GET and POST.\n\nWith a GET request you can ask for specified resource (e.g. show me that\nSlack photo).\nWith a POST request you can send content to the server to be appended to\nthe web resource (e.g. post a photo on Slack).\n\nHTTP is the language of the internet. In our case we're using JavaScript, but\nyou can send HTTP requests with other languages as well.\nAJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)\nAJAX is a technique for implementing client-server communication in the browser. The word is a bit of a misnomer as generally we don't use XML any more, but it's still commonly used to describe this technique.\n\nAjax just uses a combination of:\n\n\nA browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)\nJavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)\n\n\nAjax works behind the scenes, helping the webpage communicate with the server\n(with GET and POST requests).\n\nclient --> GET request --> server returns data to client\nclient --> POST request (with body content) --> server updates data with body content\n\nTypically, the server holds the data, and only sends it to the client (web page) when there's a\nrequest. Ajax requests are sent after the page has loaded, usually in response to an action by the user. For example when the user clicks a button, some JavaScript will trigger an Ajax request to fetch data.\nWhy Ajax?\nThere are other ways you can write HTTP requests, such as using Web sockets.\nWhat's great about Ajax is that it makes it look like magic! The server and the\nclient communicate effortlessly:\n\nUpdate a web page without reloading the page Request data from a server -\nafter the page has loaded Receive data from a server - after the page has\nloaded Send data to a server - in the background\n\nFetch\nfetch is a way of creating HTTP requests in JavaScript. It uses of the Promise API.\nThis example shows a GET request that fetches some data and logs it out:\nfetch('http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a22e20a2f0000c00d5ec665')\n  .then(function(response) {\n    // Necessary line to parse the JSON (we'll cover this \n    // in more detail in upcoming weeks)\n    // Returns another Promise\n    return response.json();\n  })\n  .then(function(json) {\n    // Do something with the json response object\n    console.log(json.data); // Logs: 'Hello world!'\n  });\n\nTo create a POST request, you can pass an options object as the second argument to fetch with the method property set to 'POST'. Any data that you want to send should be set as the body property.\nHere is an example showing a POST request:\nfetch('http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a22e20a2f0000c00d5ec665', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: 'I am sending a POST request!'\n})\n  .then(function(response) { return response.json() })\n  .then(function(json) {\n    console.log(json.data)\n  })\n\nTypically it is more useful to servers if they receive structured data like JSON. We will cover JSON more in upcoming weeks, but for now it is sufficient to know that it is a way of structuring data to send over the internet.\nTo send a POST request with JSON you need to add a little more information to the request - a headers property must be included which marks the request as contains JSON. This will give the server a hint that it needs to parse JSON in the request.\nHere is an example showing a POST request with JSON:\nfetch('http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a22e20a2f0000c00d5ec665', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    // Mark the request as containing JSON\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({ // Converts objects to JSON\n    data: 'I am sending a POST request with JSON'\n  })\n})\n\n\nExercise\nEveryone should organise in pairs to write a very simple chat application. One person will write the code to send data (with a POST request) to a server and one to fetch it (with a GET request).\n\nStart with this CodePen project\nCreate a function that makes a POST request that sends a new chat message to the server\nCreate a function that makes a GET request that fetches all messages from the server\nWire up the #fetch-messages button so that it makes the GET request then inserts the chat messages into the #message-list element\nWire up the #create-message button so that it makes the POST request\nThe URL to send requests to is https://luxuriant-scorpion.glitch.me/chat (for both GET and POST). Note that it is a JSON API, so you'll need the response.json() method to parse responses and the Content-Type header for POST requests.\n\n\nResources\n\nUnderstand JavaScript Callback Functions and Use Them\nJavaScript Callbacks Explained Using Minions\nMDN Promise docs\npromisejs.org\nGoogle Developer article on Promises\nMDN AJAX docs\nMDN fetch API\nDavid Walsh blog post\n\nHomework\n\nPlease Make sure you have finished the bookshelf project, including the\nstretch goals\nWork in pairs to do Weather App Exercise and send the link to your\nrepository on your trello card.\n\nWeather App\nWorking in pairs, build a web app displaying the 5 day weather forecast for a\nlocation of your choice.

It allows for us to more\neasily modify and extend code. It saves space and improves performance.\nAt the most basic level, a function is a series of instructions that can take an\ninput and produce an output. Parameters dictate how the function behaves.\n\n\nWe've used functions a bit, but now we need to know how to use them well.\nThere are many ways to write code that does the same thing. But are they all\nequal?\n\nExercise: Let's look at a really obvious example of a function with redundant\ncode. What could we do to improve it?\n\nfunction printHelloFiveTimes() {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n}\n\n\nExercise: write an improved version of this function\n\nNow, let's look at a different example. Let's say we wanted to welcome mentors:\nfunction welcomeMentors() {\n  console.log(\"Hello Mozafar\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Rares\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Tim\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Ashleigh\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Gordon\");\n}\n\nWe could be lazy and change how we welcome the mentors.\nfunction welcomeMentors() {\n  var mentorNames = \"Mozafar, Rares, Tim, Ashleigh, Gordon\";\n  console.log(\"Hello \" + mentorNames);\n}\n\nBut it's not quite the output we wanted. And we can be smarter about it. Why not\na loop?\n\nExercise: write an improved version of this function\n\nSo functions help us to organise and enhance our code. But what makes good\ndesign? Is it just \"shorter is always better\"?\nGood Design\nDesign is important if we want our code to be understandable (both to other\nhumans, but also to us in the future), to be easy to use and easy to expand.\nThere are three main principles you need to know now: clarity, reusability and\nextensibility. There are also others, but they are deeply related to these\nthree.\n\nEase of Maintenance / Clarity\n\nNaming\nCommenting\nClear logic\nConcise\nFormatting\nAvoiding Redundancy\n\n\nReusability\n\nDRY\nSingle Reponsibility\nAvoiding global state (scope)\nPredictability and Ease of testing\n\n\n\n\nExtensibility\n\nAvoiding being unnecessarily specific (e.g. magic numbers)\n\n\n\nNow let's take a look at a bigger example of a badly written function\nfunction myFunction(salary, taxCode, incomeTax1, incomeTax2, ownsCar) {\n  var totalIncomeTax = incomeTax1 + incomeTax2;\n  var studentLoan = (salary - 17775) * 0.09;\n  var originalSalary = salary;\n  var nationalInsurance = null;\n\n  if (taxCode === \"1150L\") {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.1;\n  } else if (taxCode === \"ST\") {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.05;\n  } else {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.08;\n  }\n\n  var deductions = [nationalInsurance, totalIncomeTax, studentLoan];\n\n  salary = salary - deductions[0];\n  salary = salary - deductions[1];\n  salary = salary - deductions[2];\n\n  return (\n    \"Your gross income is £\" +\n    originalSalary.toString() +\n    \" and your net income is £\" +\n    salary.toString() +\n    \".\"\n  );\n}\n\nconsole.log(myFunction(28000, \"1150L\", 1000, 580, false));\n\nWhat is wrong with this function?\n\nNaming: the function has a bad name, myFunction() tells you nothing about\nwhat the function does. It's also considered bad practice to name variables\nvaguely by separating them through numbers (incomeTax1, incomeTax2, etc). If\nyou find yourself doing this then you should either use an array (such as\nincomeTax[]).\n\nCommenting: the function isn't documented at all. It's very difficult to\nunderstand what the function's purpose is and how each part of the code\ncontributes to it. By writing comments, the coder communicates their\nreasoning and helps the function be human readable.\n\nLayout/formatting: unnecessary spacing between the if and else statement.\n\nSingle responsibility: the function doesn't have a single purpose. It\ncalculates national insurance and salary deductions. Maybe the national\ninsurance calculation could be moved to a separate function.\n\nInput variable being overwritten: the function requires gross salary (before\ndeductions) and net salary (after deductions) the salary input variable is\ntherefore copied into an originalSalary variable so that it can be changed.\nIt would be much clearer to create a new netSalary variable and leave\nsalary unmodified.\n\nDRY principle: the function validates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule.\nThe line where a deduction is taken from the salary is repeated 3 times with\ndifferent indices. This can be replaced with a for loop.\n\nMagic numbers. The code contains a lot of magic numbers, including 17775,\n0.09 and 0.1.\n\nUseless parameters: the code contains a variable which isn't used. They\nshould be removed because they are confusing. It is tempting when you're\nstarting to code a function to add more parameters thinking that you might\nneed them, but it's important to remove them if you don't end up using them.\n\n\n\nExercise: Working in pairs, go through all of these issues and make\nappropriate improvements to the code.\nExercise: Write a function that will print out the number of vowels that are\nin mentors' names.\n\nResources\n\nJavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford, chapter 4 - Functions\nMDN Objects basics\nMDN OOP in JS\n\nTDD\n What we will learn today?\n\nUnit Testing\nThe Jest testing framework\nThe test() function\nexpect() and toBe()\nnpm test\nTest coverage\n\n\nTest-driven development (TDD)\nRed, green, refactoring\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get started\n\nFork >\nthis repository to\nyour own Github account, then clone it to your computer.\\\nToday's exercises will be based on this repository.\n\nUnit Testing\nTesting is a key skill for any software programmer. We need to make sure our\nsoftware is thoroughly tested, otherwise bad things happen. Testing makes sure\nour programs behave like we intend them to do - if we don't test, we can cause\nsevere bugs. Bad software can make planes crash, companies bankrupt, and users\nof your software really frustrated.\nThere are different levels on which we can test software, for example\nintegration testing, end-to-end testing, and unit testing. Today we will deal\nwith unit testing, which is probably the most universal testing discipline.\nA unit test is exactly that - it tests a unit of code. \"Unit\" can mean\ndifferent things, but in JavaScript it usually refers to a single function.\nRemember when we talked about functions? Functions take input (as arguments),\ndo something with it (in the function body), and return output (using the\nreturn statement). Ideally, a function should always return the same output if\nthe same input is given. It makes it predictable and testable - and that's what\nwe want!\n         |-----------------|\ninput => | doing something | => output\n         |-----------------|\nSo, when unit testing a function, we want to make sure that for a certain\ninput, we get the expected output. For this we need to make sure that the\noutput matches our expectations. In the simplest form that means we do an\nequality check:\nmyFunction(input) === expectedOutput;\n\nWe can formalise this using another function that compares two values and\ncomplains when they do not match. Such a function is prepared in\nunit-testing/equals.js.\nWe can use this function to simply compare to values:\nequals(1, 1); // This should pass\nequals(1, 2); // This should fail\nequals(\"Hello\", \"Hello\"); // This should pass\n\nNow we can use this equals() function to test our own code by comparing a\nfunction result to an expected value.\n\nTogether: Follow the instructions in unit-testing/sum.js!\nExercise: Now you! Take the provided unit-testing/findNeedle.js and turn\nit into a function that returns a result instead of printing it. Then run it\nusing multiple inputs and make sure it returns the correct results each time!\n\nTest-driven development (TDD)\n\nTest-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on\nthe repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into\nvery specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests,\nonly. (Wikipedia)\n\nA key principle in TDD is that we write think about our requirements before we\ndive into code: What should our program be able to do? What are our edge cases?\nWe formalise those requirements by writing tests - even before our program is\nwritten! At this time, all our tests will fail, because we haven't written any\ncode yet. Our tests are now RED (the colour represents a failing test).\nNow we want to turn this RED into GREEN. We do this by implementing our\nfunction in a way that covers all our test cases.\n\nExercise: Follow the instructions in tdd/findNeedle.js!\n\nRefactoring\nThere are times when we want to make our code better without changing any\nfunctionality, for example because we just learnt about a better way to solve a\ncertain problem (like, finding needles in haystacks). This is called\nrefactoring.\nWhen previously GREEN code - working code! - suddenly does not work anymore,\nwe call this a regression. Our existing tests can make sure that when we\nrefactor, the functionality of our code actually stays the same, and does not\nregress.\n\nTogether: Refactor the findNeedle function we just wrote to be implemented\nusing .map() and .filter().\n\nUnit testing frameworks\nThere are lots of other things you might want to test for than two things being\nequal. You might want to test if a number is smaller or greater than another, if\na function was called, if an error happened, or if one thing happened before\nanother thing, or how long a function call took to execute.\nWe don't have to build all these things ourselves. Instead there are unit\ntesting frameworks that take all that work off our shoulders. All we need to do\nis provide the code and the tests.\nJest\nThe unit testing framework we are trying to day is called\nJest. It's created by Facebook and useful\nfor all kinds of unit testing (especially testing React, which we will do in a\nlater lesson).\nLook into your jest/ folder. You will find a file there, sum.test.js. The\nsuffix .test.js tells Jest that this file contains tests it should execute. To\nexecute the test, run the following command in your terminal:\nnpm test\n\nThis command runs the test in sum.test.js, which tests the sum() function.\nYou can see the test output and the fact that the test passed.\nTests cases in Jest have the following structure:\ntest(\"test description\", function() {\n  // Test instructions\n});\n\nJest provides a set of functions that you can use to write your actual tests.\nThey are created in a way that imitates natural language, for example:\n_Expect_ sum of 1 and 2 _to be_ 3\nbecomes\nexpect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);\n\nYou can add multiple test statements in the same test case (a test case is one\ncall of the test function, but you can also create multiple test cases in one\nfile. It is important that you give all your test cases meaningful descriptions.\n\nExercise: Add another test case to sum.test.js. Is the sum of 10 and -10\nreally zero? Run the tests using Jest.\nExercise: Take the findNeedle function you have tested previously, copy it\ninto the jest/ folder and call it findNeedle.test.js. Then write a test to\nbe used with Jest, similar to sum.test.js. Make sure you cover multiple\ninputs and give all tests meaningful descriptions! Run the tests using Jest.\n\nTest coverage\nTest coverage describes the extent to which a code base is tested. When Jest\nruns your tests, it generates a so-called coverage report. This report tells\nyou how many of your lines of code are covered by tests, how many functions,\nstatements, and branches.\n\nA branch is one of multiple ways a code control flow can go. For example, if\nyou have an if() ... else ..., both the \"if\" and the \"else\" branch must be\ncovered by tests.\n\nWe want to keep our code coverage as high as possible. Jest allows us to\ngenerate a coverage report when we run the following command in the terminal:\nnpm test -- --coverage\n\n\nExercise: Check your code coverage for the tests you wrote. Is any of the\nnumbers below 100%? If so, try and bring it up to 100%!\n\nResources\n\nTest-driven development\nJest\nModules\n\n"},"js-core-3/week-11/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-3/week-11/lesson.html","title":"Week 11 - More TDD, ES6","keywords":"","body":"\nJavaScript Core 3\n What we will learn today?\n\nIntro to ES6\nClasses and Context\nInheritance\n\n\nIntro to ES6\nECMAScript 2015 (or ES6) is a significant update to JavaScript that introduces\nnew syntax for writing complex applications including classes and modules and\nother features.\nconst and let\nYou have already come across the var keyword as a way to create new variables.\nThe let and const keywords are also used for variable creation, but the\nvariables created using these keywords have different scope.

Let's see how it\nworks.\nExercise: Refactor the previous code to have a separate function that checks\nif gender is 'female' or not, and use it in sayGreeting. Let's try and make\nthe code as compact as possible together using ES6 features.\n\nClasses and Context\nA class is an important concept in object-oriented programming. In general, a\nclass can be described as a \"blueprint\" or a \"plan\" for creating objects. After\na class is created, new objects with all of the features defined in that class\ncan then be created. These objects are called instances of the class.\nSecondly, It's hard to talk about objects without talking about context and the\nthis keyword. When we execute a function in javascript, that function is\nassociated with some enclosing object. That object could be one that we made\nourselves, or it could be the global scope (the Window object). Understanding\ncontext allows us to understand when and where we can manipulate an object's\nproperties.\nA warning about javascript \"classes\"\nSpeaking strictly, javascript does not have proper classes. However ES6 provides\nfunctionality that allows us to create things that usually look and act like\nproper classes. At this point in your learning, this difference might not seem\nimportant but it will be useful to remember when you are doing more complex work\nin the future. Part of the homework after this class is to read about these\ndifferences.\nCreating a class\nI own a library and want to keep track of the books that people are borrowing\nand returning. Using the style that we previously learned, we could implement a\nsystem like this:\nlet myBooks = [\n  \"Wild Swans\",\n  \"The Dharma Bums\",\n  \"Nausea\",\n  \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\"\n];\nlet library = {\n  books: myBooks,\n  availableBooks: myBooks,\n  checkoutBook: function(book) {\n    this.availableBooks = this.availableBooks.filter(b => b !== book);\n  }\n};\n\nNow our book system has become popular in the library world, and we need to\nrepresent a lot of different libraries, each one requiring a copy of the object\nformat we specified above. We might even need to extend our library object to\nsuit specific cases. We can prepare for this scenario by creating a class called\nLibrary, provided a plan for our library objects.\nclass Library {\n  constructor(books) {\n    this.books = books;\n    this.availableBooks = books;\n  }\n\n  checkoutBook(book) {\n    this.availableBooks = this.availableBooks.filter(b => b !== book);\n  }\n}\n\nlet myBooks = [\n  \"Wild Swans\",\n  \"The Dharma Bums\",\n  \"Nausea\",\n  \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\"\n];\nlet myLibrary = new Library(myBooks);\n\n\nExercise: Add a returnBook function which appends a book onto the\navailableBooks variable in our myLibrary object.\nExercise: check out \"Nausea\" and return it to the library.\nExercise: Alter the checkoutBook function to return false when a book\nisn't available, and true otherwise.\n\nUsing Inheritance to extend our library\nWe want to store information about a new library which contains audiobooks as\nwell as ordinary books. Audiobooks cannot be checked out, so they only need to\nbe stored. This new library should have all the same functionality regarding\nordinary books as our old Library object, but the class should be extended to\nallow for the storage of an audiobooks array.\nMore on this\n\nExercise: what does this refer to in the following code snippets?\n\nfunction getThis() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nclass MyClass {\n  getThis() {\n    return this;\n  }\n}\n\nlet myClass = new MyClass();\nconsole.log(myClass.getThis());\n\nclass MyClass {\n  getThis() {\n    let myObject = {\n      thisFunction: function() {\n        return this;\n      }\n    };\n    return myObject.thisFunction();\n  }\n}\n\nlet myClass = new MyClass();\nconsole.log(myClass.getThis());\n\nclass MyClass {\n  getThis() {\n    let myObject = { thisFunction: () => this };\n    return myObject.thisFunction();\n  }\n}\n\nlet myClass = new MyClass();\nconsole.log(myClass.getThis());\n\nMore ES6\nThere are so many features in ES6. They're mostly what we call syntax sugar.\nThey don't provide new functionality, but new (more elegant) ways of\naccomplishing the same tasks.\nSince not all ES6 features are supported in all browsers, many developers and\nprojects use what is called Transpilation - a process that\ntranspiles/translates ES6 code to ES5 syntax that is supported by all browsers.\nOn Node, most ES6 features are now natively supported in Node 8.\n\nFrom now on, we expect you to use ES6 syntax in your assignments and the code\nyou write.\n\nTDD again\n\nExercise: Clone the repo https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-core-2-exercises\nLet's talk about TDD again?\n\nWhy do we do TDD\nHow do we run the tests? Read some of the tests\nNotice we're separating our tests from our code now. We are making use of\nmodules\nAlso notice the coverage\n\n\nHow do modules work?\nSo far, all our programs have been in their own single files. But Node programs\ncan become really large, and having all our code in only one file will not be\nmaintainable.\nWe can therefore split our code into so-called modules. A module is basically\na JavaScript file that makes its functionality available to other modules and\nprograms.\nCreating modules, exporting code\nIt is really simple to take existing JavaScript code and turn it into a module\nby exporting its functionality:\nfunction printName(name) {\n  console.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = printName;\n\nThe key here is the line containing module.exports. As you see, this is an\nassignment, and whatever is assigned to module.exports will be made available\nto other modules and program when this file is imported.\nUsing modules, importing code\nBut how do we make use of another module in our program? We need to import it,\nand this is done using a function called require().\n\nThere are different module formats for JavaScript. The one we are using here,\nwhich is natively supported by Node, is called CommonJS.\n\nvar printName = require(\"./printName.js\");\n\n\nThe string passed to the require() function is a path to the file you are\nimporting. ./ signifies the current directory, so the above command will\nimport a file called \"printName.js\" that is in the same directory as our\nprogram.\n\nAssuming our program is in the same folder as printName.js, we can use the\nabove code to import the functionality provided by that module and store it in\nthe printName variable.\nWe can then continue to use the printName function as if it we defined it in\nour own program!\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\nprintName();\n\nModules can not only export functions, but all variable types you already\nlearned about. Most commonly, they export a function or an object containing\nmultiple functions.\nTogether: Edit the file modules/main.js and follow the instructions.\n\nSeparating code and tests\nExporting and importing modules is really useful for testing, too.\nAs a rule of thumb, we never want to mix our actual code with our tests. It is\ntherefore common to put them in separate files. We are going to call the file\ncontaining the tests after the file containing the code to be tested, just\nappending .test at the end of the filename. Like so:\nmain.js               # Our main program\nmain.test.js          # Tests for our main program\nsomeOtherCode.js      # A module called \"someOtherCode\"\nsomeOtherCode.test.js # Tests for the \"someOtherCode\" module\n\nThe naming is really up to convention - you can even put your tests in a\ndifferent folder! However, for Jest it is important to call test files\n\"*.test.js\".\n\nResources\n\nES6 features\nLet and const\n\n"},"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html","title":"Week 12 - Exam maybe","keywords":"","body":"\nTo Be Agreed\nJS Core III\n What we will learn today?\n\nTopic 1\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nTopic 4\n\n\nTopic 1\nHigh level explanation of Topic 1 - rely on the exercises\n\nExercise: Always have exercises\n\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nResources\n\nResource 1 to learn more about Topic 1\nResource 2 for Topic 2\n\nHomework\n\nFirst part of Homework - Easy\n\nSecond part of Homework - Intermediate/Hard\n\n[Bonus/Optional] Third part/optional - Hardest\n\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nRead this Some Tutorial or Video etc...\n\n"},"node-db/":{"url":"node-db/","title":"Node/DB I","keywords":"","body":"Node\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\n\n\n\n\nweek-13\nNode, Express workshop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"node-db/week-13/lesson.html":{"url":"node-db/week-13/lesson.html","title":"Week 13 - Node and Express 101","keywords":"","body":"Node 1\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nNode and its ecosystem\nExpress\nHttp\nJSON format\nfs\n\n\n\nThis class is based on the\nNode Girls Express Workshop\n\nWhat is a server?\nServers are computer programs that receive requests from other programs, the\nclients and send back a response e.g share data, information or hardware and\nsoftware resources.\n...and what is a server in plain English?\nA server is a computer program. Its job is to send and receive data.\nLet's take a website for example. A website is just a collection of HTML and CSS\nfiles, images, maybe some javascript files.

It simplifies base features of Node.js, making it easier and faster to\nbuild your application's backend. Learning Express gives you a great foundation\nfor becoming a Node.js developer.\nIn the next steps, we will building a CMS (Content Management System) - a\nsystem to write, publish and save blog posts. Even though we could use core\nlibraries like http to build this system, this becomes very complicated and\nnon-maintainable very quickly. That is why we use frameworks like Express.\nBefore you Start\nFork the repository https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/express-workshop\n$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/express-workshop\nStep 1 - Setting up your project\nWhen creating a Node.js project, you will be installing a lot of different\nthings along the way. If you want to share your project with others, you need to\nhave a list of the things you installed, so that other people know what to\ninstall in order to run the project.\nIn Node.js, this 'list' file is called a package.json. The 'things you've\ninstalled' are referred to as dependencies. Creating this file is the first\nstep in setting up your Node.js project.\n1. Make a package.json file\nLet's start by creating the package.json file. We can add things to it as the\nproject grows. The package.json file is easy to create from the command line.\nType the following command into your terminal to get started:\n$ npm init\n\nThis command will initialise a step-by-step process for creating the\npackage.json. You should see something like this:\n\nIt will ask you a bunch of questions.\n\nYou can skip most of the questions but change the entry point from\n(index.js) to server.js.\nThe wizard asks you for the following information: name, version,\ndescription, main, test, repository, keywords, author, license -\ndo you understand all of them?\n\nAt the endo of the wizard, you should see a new file called package.json in\nyour project's folder.\nHere is an example package.json file for a project called\nPassport.\nWhat is JSON?\nJSON is a type of file for structuring data in a readable way. It is also a\nreally popular format for sending data across the web. JSON is a string\nrepresentation of a Javascript object. JSON objects convert really easily to\nJavascript objects, and vice versa, with JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify().\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"isAlive\": true,\n  \"age\": 25,\n  \"address\": {\n    \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",\n    \"city\": \"New York\",\n    \"state\": \"NY\",\n    \"postalCode\": \"10021-3100\"\n  },\n  \"phoneNumbers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"home\",\n      \"number\": \"212 555-1234\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"office\",\n      \"number\": \"646 555-4567\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"mobile\",\n      \"number\": \"123 456-7890\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"children\": [],\n  \"spouse\": null\n}\n\nStep 2 - Installing Express\nBefore we write any code, you'll need to install the Express library. We're\ngoing to use the Node Package Manager (npm) to\ndownload it using the npm install command.\nNPM is the place to go to download other Node code written by other people.\nThere are thousands of open-source, 3rd-party Node modules (also known as\n\"packages\") by other people that you can download and use in your own projects.\nAs we install Express, we'll need to update the package.json to add Express as\na dependency. We do this so that other people working on the project will know\nto install Express before running any of the code. This can be done by adding\n--save to the end of your command.\nRun the following command in your terminal:\n$ npm install express --save\nExpress should now be installed. Check your package.json file to make sure it\nhas been added as a dependency. It will look like this:\n\nStep 3 - Building the server\nThe first thing we need to do is build our server. You will always need to build\na server when writing back-end code. A server can be built in pure Node.js, but\nExpress gives us simpler syntax to work with.\n1. Create a server.js file\nLet's build our server! Before we do anything, let's create a new file called\nserver.js. This is where all our server code is going to live.\n2. require the express library\nWe already installed Express in Step 2, but we need to make sure it is included\nin this file specifically so we can make use of its methods. In Node.js, when\nyou want to access the functionality of a library or module in another file, you\nrequire it.\nTo import Express, write the following inside server.js:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\n\n\nWe will try and get used to ES6 syntax - so use const and let instead of\nvar.\n\n3. Initialise the server\nTo initialise our server, we just need to call the express() function. This\nwill create an Express application for us to work with.\nAdd the second line of code to your server.js file:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\n4. Start 'listening' for potential requests\nOne more step left, we need to set a port for our server to listen to. Think\nof a port as a door number; any requests that come to the server will come via\nthat door. Setting a port will allow us to find where our server is running.\nWe use the app.listen method to do this. This method takes two arguments:\na port and a callback function telling it what to do once the server is\nrunning. Need clarification? Read more about the app.listen method in the\nExpress documentation.\nWe're going to run our server on port 3000, and run a simple console.log as\nour callback function. Update your server.js file, calling the app.listen\nmethod:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n\nTry to use ES6 arrow functions instead of function.\n\n5. Switch the server on!\nYou've built your server, but it isn't running yet. We need to run a command in\nthe terminal to do this. We are going to use the node keyword to run the\nserver file.\nType the following command in your terminal:\n$ node server.js\n\nIf you see this, congratulations! You have built yourself a server!\n\nStep 4 - Communicating with the server\nNow that we've built the server, we need to communicate with it. We're going to\ncontrol the server with handler functions.\nWhat is a handler function?\nWhen a request reaches the server, we need a way of responding to it. In comes\nthe handler function. The handler function is just a function which receives\nrequests and handles them, hence the name.\nThe handler function always takes a request and response object, and sends\nthe response back to the client along with some information. You can decide what\nto send back in your response.\nWhat does a handler function look like in Express?\nThe get() method is used to\ndefine a handler function in Express. It takes two parameters: the endpoint\nat which to trigger an action (we'll explain more about this in the next step),\nand the handler function that tells it exactly what to do. Here's a simple\n\"Hello World!\" example:\n// req is the Request object, res is the Response object\n// (these are just variable names, they can be anything but it's a convention to call them req and res)\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\nHere, we are telling our server to respond with \"Hello World!\" when someone\ntries to access the webpage.\n1. Create your own handler function.\nWe are now making a handler function with a custom message in our response. You\ncan write any message you want.\nUpdate your server.js file with an empty app.get() function:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {});\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Try to console.log the request object inside the handler\nfunction. Restart your server, refresh the browser, then go to your terminal\nto see what it looks like. You should see a lot of data come through.\n\n2. Tell your handler function what to do\nWe want our handler function to send back a message to the client. To do that,\nwe're going to use the Express send()\nmethod. This will update the\nresponse object with the message.\nUpdate your handler function like so:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Yay Node Girls!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n3. Check it out in your browser\nQuit your server in the terminal with ctrl + c. Then restart it to run your\nnew changes.\n$ node server.js\n\nNow, open your favourite browser (we like Chrome), and navigate to\nhttp://localhost:3000. If you see your message in the browser,\ncongratulations! You just sent your first response from the server.\nStep 5 - Routing\nAt the moment our server only does one thing. When it receives a request from\nthe / endpoint, it sends back the same response: \"Yay Node Girls!\".\n\nTry typing http://localhost:3000/nodegirls and see what happens.\n\nHowever by making use of endpoints, we can make the server send different\nresponses for different requests. This concept is called routing.\nWhat is an endpoint?\nAn endpoint is the part of the URL which comes after /. For example:\n/chocolate is the \"chocolate\" endpoint. It's the URL to which you send a\nrequest.\nWhat is URL?\n\n1. Create your own endpoints and send different responses\nWe're going to try sending different responses at different endpoints. Remember\nthe app.get() method? To set up routing in your server, we just need to repeat\nthis method with different endpoints.\nFor example:\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.get(\"/chocolate\", function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Mm chocolate :O\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add some code so that your server sends one message when the\nendpoint is /node and another one when it's /girls.\n\nStep 6 - Serving static files\nSo we know how to send back a simple message. But what if you want to send back\na whole HTML page, or an image?\nThings like HTML files, images etc are known as static assets. If you want\nyour server to \"serve\" static assets back to the browser, you need to do\nsomething different than just using the res.send() method.\nTo be able to send any file from the server we need a special, built-in\nmiddleware function that comes with Express: express.static(). Read more\nabout it here.\nSay we want to serve all the static assets in our \"public\" folder. The\nexpress.static() function will look like this:\napp.use(express.static(\"public\"));\n\n1. Serve static files from your server\nDelete all your app.get endpoint functions, and replace them with the line of\ncode above. Restart your server, refresh your browser and see what happens! If\nyou see a Node Girls CMS, then your static assets have been successfully served.\nHTTP request methods\nAll requests use one of the HTTP methods. The main ones are: GET, POST, PUT,\nDELETE.\napp.get deals with requests that use the GET HTTP method.\n\nWe will go into these Methods into more details, but for now, think of GET\nas a method for Getting data. POST is for POSTing/inserting new data. PUT\nis for updating. DELETE is for deleting data.\n\nThe POST http request method\nWhen sending data to the server, we use the POST http request method, instead\nof GET.\nLet's try POSTing some text to the server.\nWe're going to add a form to the index.html page, so that you can write your\nblogposts from there.\nOpen up the index.html file in your text editor. If you have a look, you\nshould see this:\n\n    \n\n\nReplace the greyed-out comment with this code snippet:\nCreate a blog post\n\n    \n    Send\n\n\n\nThis form has a text area and a Send button.\nThe action attribute is the endpoint form data will be sent to.\nThe name attribute will be used later to reference the data.\n\nWhen you hit Send, the form will send a POST request to the server, using\nwhatever is in the action attribute as the endpoint. In our case it's\n/create-post.\n\nExercise: Open Chrome Developers tool, click the button and see what\nhappens.\n\nReceiving the blog post on the server\n\nData doesn't come through the server in one go; it flows to the server in a\nstream. Think of a stream as water flowing from a tap into a bucket. Your\njob is to collect this water in the server.\n\nIf we were writing a pure Node server, we would have to think about how to\ncollect the stream of data properly. But luckily for us, Express handles all\nof that stuff under the hood.\n\nAll you need to do is define a route to deal with requests that come through\non the /create-post endpoint.\n\n\nLet's remind ourselves of a simple GET route in Express:\napp.get(\"/hello-world\", function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Hello there!\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: This time we want to define a route to deal with a POST\nrequest not a GET. What do you think you would need to do differently?\nExperiment and see if you can define a route for the /create-post endpoint!\nFor now, make your /create-post handler simply do this: console.log('I am\n/create-post endpoint').\n\n\nExtracting the blog post\nNow the contents of your blogpost is hidden in your req object somewhere.\nNormally you would extract it using req.body. Try to console.log req.body\nnow.\nGetting undefined? Not to worry, that's normal. When data has been POSTed to\nthe server as FormData, we need to do things slightly differently to access\nthe data that's come through in the request.\nWe need another middleware function. Something that can get extract the contents\nout of the special FormData object. For this we will use express-formidable.\nexpress-formidable is another Express middleware. It will extract the form\ndata from the request and make it available to you when you do req.fields.\nThis time though, express-formidable is not built-in, we need to explicitly\ninstall it.\nIn your terminal, install express-formidable\nnpm install express-formidable --save\n\nrequire express-formidable so you can use it in your code. You can't use\ndashes in JavaScript variable names, so just call it const formidable.\nconst formidable = require(\"express-formidable\");\n\nNow add this towards the top of your server, after your requires and\napp.use(express.static('public')), but before your /create-post endpoint:\napp.use(formidable());\n\nNow inside your /create-post function, add:\nconsole.log(req.fields);\n\nRefresh your server and have another go at writing a blogpost.\nYou should now see an object in the console. The key should be blogpost, just\nlike the name attribute in the form on the HTML page. The value of blogpost\nwill be your message!\n\nExercise: Try putting app.use(formidable()); at the end of the file\n(after the create-post but before starting the server)\nWhat is a middleware in Express? Middleware functions are functions that\nhave access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the\nnext function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next function\nis a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the\nmiddleware succeeding the current middleware. Read more on\nthe Express documentation\n\nStep 8 - Saving your blog post\nRight now, your precious blog posts aren't being saved anywhere, which is a bit\nof a shame. Let's do something about that.\nYou'll note that in the data folder there's a new file called posts.json.\nIf you look at posts.json will see there's already one blog post there. The\nformat is:\n{\n    [timestamp]: [blog post message]\n}\n\nWe've used a timestamp as the key so that the blog posts are listed in\nchronological order. Also, it's a record of when the blog post was created.\nWriting to your hard drive\nAnytime a blog post comes through to the server, we want to save the data on\nyour computer's hard drive. To do this, we need to use a built-in Node module:\nfs, which stands for 'file-system'.\nBuilt-in Node modules - core Node modules - are rather like the built-in\nExpress middleware functions. Only difference is that where you need to have\ninstalled Express to use Express middleware functions, the core Node modules\ncome automatically with Node itself.\nTo use fs, you'll need to require it at the top of your server file:\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nThe method we need to write to your hard drive is fs.writeFile.\nfs.writeFile(\"path/to/file\", yourData, function(error) {\n  // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to write to\nArgument 2: the data you want to write\nArgument 3: the callback function\n\nThe 'path/to/file' will be replaced with the actual path to the file you want to\nwrite to. If it doesn't exist, fs.writeFile cleverly creates one for you. But\nwe already have posts.json, so not to worry.\nReading from your hard drive\nTo read data that's already there, you would use fs.readFile. The way to use\nfs.readFile is very similar to fs.writeFile:\nfs.readFile(\"path/to/file\", function(error, file) {\n  // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to write to\nArgument 2: the callback function\n\nYou'll notice that fs.readFile's callback function takes a second argument.\nThat argument would be the file you're reading.\nLet's read the data from the posts.json file. Make sure you've required the\nfs core Node module at the top of your server file somewhere.\nAdd this code to your server (put it anywhere after the requires for now):\nfs.readFile(__dirname + \"/data/posts.json\", function(error, file) {\n  console.log(file);\n});\n\n(__dirname is a Node global object that gives you a path to current working\ndirectory. It's handy if we want to avoid writing the whole path out in full.)\nIf you restart the server, you'll probably see something like this:\n\n\nThis is actually the contents of your posts.json file, but in a format called\na buffer. To make it a bit more human-readable, you can console.log the file\nto a string, like this:\nconsole.log(file.toString());\n\nfile is in JSON format right now. If we want to access the blog post message\ninside file, we need to parse it from JSON back to a JavaScipt object.\nAdd this next bit of code to your fs.readFile's callback function:\nconst parsedFile = JSON.parse(file);\n\nNow parsedFile is a normal JavaScript object, and we can access the data\ninside it.\nOk, so we've talked about JSON and we've talked about reading and writing files.\nYou now have the power to save new blog post data to your hard drive! Work with\nyour partner and your mentor to see if you can figure the next steps out on your\nown.\nHere's a breakdown of what you want to achieve:\n\nWhen new blog post data comes through, read from posts.json to access its\ncontents\nAdd your new blog post data to the old ones.\nWrite your new combined data back to the posts.json file.\n\nThings to remember\n\nfs.writeFile() normally overwrites the target file you've given it. Chances\nare you don't want to lose all your old blog posts every time you get a new\none, so think about how you can combine fs.readFile() and fs.writeFile()\nto prevent overwriting.\n\nYou will need to convert between JSON and a JavaScript object several times.\nJSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() are what you need.\n\n\nOh by the way, if you want to get the current timestamp, use the JavaScript\nDate.now() method.\nStep 9 - Displaying your blog posts\nSo now we're saving the blog posts to the server. Time to get them and display\nthem on the page!\nIf you look inside public/script.js, there's a whole bunch of JavaScript code\nin there. Don't worry about what all the code means, just know that it's\nresponsible for sending a request to GET old blog posts and display them on the\npage underneath \"Recent Posts\".\nscript.js is trying to load existing posts by making a GET request. Look\ninside script.js and see if you can find any useful endpoints.\nYour script.js file will want to receive the JSON containing your blog posts.\nYour job is to make that happen!\nExpress has a handy method called res.sendFile() that makes it easy to send\nfiles back to the client. Feel free to use this with your JSON.\nIf all goes well, you should have a fully functional CMS!\nGroup Research Topics\n\nSecurity: (https, same origin, cookies, xss etc..)\nPerformance: Request lifecycle (from browser to server and back), Performance\nconsiderations and optimisations\nHTTP and REST: (headers, status codes, Cookies, REST)\nNode internals: Node event loop, Node core modules, async/sync (non-blocking\noperations)\n\nThe research will be on a Github repo.

Wouldn't be nice if we could change one file and that reflects in all pages.\nAt the moment, we're just serving static HTML files from the public folder.\nNodeJS and ExpressJS allows us to build dynamic web pages.\n\nA server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled\nby an application server that processes server-side scripts. In server-side\nscripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page\nproceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nWebsites - a small detour\nWhat is wrong with this\nwebsite?\nIs this one any\nbetter?\nThe final view is\nhere\nWhat was missing in the first example?\n\nSo what is the point of all these?\n\nTemplate Engines\nA template engine enables you to use static template files in your application.\nAt runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with\nactual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client.\nThis approach makes it easier to design an HTML page, as it reduces duplicate\ncode (DRY).\nSome popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache,\nand EJS.\nHandlebars Templating Engine\nWe will use Handlebars as the\ntemplating engine for this class.\nTo add it to your project: npm install --save express-handlebars\nThen in your server.js, we need to configure the middleware for Handlebars.\n// Add this to the top of your file\nconst exphbs = require(\"express-handlebars\");\n\n// Then these two lines after you initialise your express app\napp.engine(\"handlebars\", exphbs({ defaultLayout: \"main\" }));\napp.set(\"view engine\", \"handlebars\");\n\n\nLet's look at the folder views/layouts/main.handlebars\n\n\nThere is a placeholder for body where the \"body\" get injected - can you\nfind it?\nNotice the index.handlebars, my-cv.handlebars and admin.handlebars.\n\nThen add these routes:\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n  res.render(\"index\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add similar endpoints for /my-cv and /admin.\nExercise: Let's create a template called contact and delete the endpoint\nwe created earlier for /contact - render a view instead - similar to what we\ndid with the previous endpoints.\nExercise: Remember how we changed Contact to Contact Information?\nTry to change now Contact Information to Get in touch. Was it any\neasier?\n\nTemplate passing info from Controller to Template\nWhen we were using the static HTML pages from public/ folder - the heading\ntext shown on top of the page (on the photo) used to change when we go to\ndifferent pages. Now that we switched to the template, we've lost that behavior\nas the code for this part comes from the centralised Layout\n(views/layouts/main.handlebars).\nHow can we imitate that behavior without having to duplicate code or serve\nstatic files? Express and Handlebars allow you to pass data between the\nroutes and the views. Here is how we can do it:\n\nLet's modify the / route to pass the title of the page.\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n  res.render(\"index\", {\n    title: \"Etzali Profile\" // insert your name instead\n  });\n});\n\n\nIn /views/layouts/main.handlebars, let's use the data we're passing to the\ntemplate\n\n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            A modern Website built in Node\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Pass the subheading from the route to the view as well.\nExercise: Change Title to default to \"My Profile\" if no title was\nprovided. Look at #if helpers for Handlebars\nhttp://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html\n\nPartials\nHandlebars allows for template reuse through partials. Partials are normal\nHandlebars templates that may be called directly by other templates.\n(Handlebars documentation)\nLet's put the Menu in a partial.\n\nGo to layout/main.handlebars and cut the  with all its contents, and\nmove it to a new file called menu.handlebars under views/partials.\n\nThen to use the partial, add {{> menu}} in the place where you cut the\noriginal menu from.\nMore Templating\nThere is much more that can be done with Handlebars templating engine. Skim\nthrough the express-handlebars\nand handlebars documentation\nFor now, we will finish by using the each helper.\nDynamically loading the templates\n{{#each posts}}\n    \n        \n            \n                {{this.title}}\n            \n            \n                {{this.summary}}\n            \n        \n    \n{{/each}}\n\nIn the route, let's load the file in data/posts.json:\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n  const filePath = __dirname + \"/data/posts.json\";\n  const callbackFunction = function(error, file) {\n    // we call .toString() to turn the file buffer to a String\n    const fileData = file.toString();\n    // we use JSON.parse to get an object out the String\n    const postsJson = JSON.parse(fileData);\n    // send the json to the Template to render\n    res.render(\"index\", {\n      title: \"Etzali Profile\", // insert your name instead\n      posts: postsJson\n    });\n  };\n  fs.readFile(filePath, callbackFunction);\n});\n\nCallbacks\nIn JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. That means they can be used in\na first class manner like any other object since they are objects themselves. We\ncan pass them as arguments to functions which is common technique in JavaScript\nfor dealing with asynchronous behaviour. We have in fact already encountered\ncallbacks when we looked at array methods such as .forEach(), .map() and\n.filter.\nconst evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];\nevenNumbers.forEach(function(num) {\n  console.log(num);\n});\n\nHere we are passing the function( num ) {console.log(num);} function as an\nargument to .forEach() to execute with each item in the array evenNumbers.\nThe above example is synchronous which means that code the callback is\nexecuted immediately. Let's look at an example where the code is executed\nasynchronously. We will use a setTimeout function to delay execution here.\nIn most JavaScript applications asynchronous code execution could be in response\nto an event such as mouse click or data coming back from a server. We will look\nat both of those cases in detail in a future class.\nfunction delay(callback) {\n  setTimeout(callback, 2000);\n}\n\nfunction logRandom() {\n  const value = Math.round(Math.random() * 10);\n  console.log(value);\n  return value;\n}\n\ndelay(logRandom);\n\nKey points\n\nFunctions can be passed as arguments to other other function\nFunctions that are passed as arguments are called callbacks\nCallbacks may be executed immediately or later\nIf a callback is executed later, its return value is lost\n\n\nExercise: What other Asynchronous operations have we recently used in the\nNode code we've written?\nExercise: On the CV page, there is a button, Get Repos List, that\ndoesn't work. There is code to make it work at js\\github-client.js. Add\njs\\github-client.js to your pages.\n\nThe client-side code in github-client.js should look familiar.\n\nExercise: Identify all the callbacks in this code. Refactor the\nanonymous functions to their own variables and use the variables instead.\n(Bonus point if you use arrow functions)\n\nCallback hell\nIn the code where we retrieve the repos data from Github, imagine if we had a\nrequirement, that for each repo retrieved, we have to make another API call to\nretrieve all the available branches (there is a property called branches_url\nthat we can use to get that info). And then, once we have all the branches, make\nanother API call to get the info for each branch.\nThe code to do so, will look something similar to this:\nvar oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\noReq.addEventListener(\"load\", function() {\n  var oReq2 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  oReq2.addEventListener(\"load\", function() {\n    var oReq3 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    oReq2.addEventListener(\"load\", function() {\n      // 4. Now we finally have all the info we need and we can the info we retrieved from the three API calls.\n    });\n    oReq3.open(\"GET\", url); // 3. third url for branch info\n    oReq3.send();\n  });\n  oReq.open(\"GET\", url); // 2. second url for branches\n  oReq.send();\n});\noReq.open(\"GET\", url); // 1. first url for Repo\noReq.send();\n\nThe code above is very hard to understand and follow. Notice the pyramid shape\n}) - This is often called the callback hell.\nAPIs\nAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for applications to\ncommunicate with each other. We already consumed an API earlier in the day:\nGithub API. We managed to communicate with Github and get important\ninformation. We - the client - can use this information in a number of different\nways. Our client, in this case, is a Web page but it could have easily been a\nMobile Application, or a TV setbox etc...\n\nLet's watch this video about APIs -\nWhat is an API\nExercise: Let's expose the posts.json as an API for other clients to\nconsume through the url /api/get-posts. Hint: make use res.sendFile\n\nREST API\nREST (REpresentational State Transfer) and RESTful APIs provide a way (an\narchitecture) for building APIs that is simple and scalable.\nThere are many constraints and aspects to building a REST API, but one\nfundamental constraint is the use of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and HTTP\nMethods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc..)\nIn our endpoint that we just created /api/get-posts, the get part of the\nURL is redundant as the HTTP Method GET already tells that we are GETting a\nResource. The Resource in this case is called posts.\n\nExercise: Let's rename our endpoint to /posts so that it follows RESTful\narchitecture.\nWhat would the endpoint for creating posts be called?\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA - What is a REST API\n(up to 3 minutes)\n\nREST is a big topic that we will revisit again. The table below from Wikipedia\nshows how a typical RESTful API would look like.\n\nWikipedia\nFor now, remember when building APIs, to use Resource names to identify your\nendpoints and make use of the HTTP methods (Verbs) to describe operations\nperformed on those resources.\nDeploying to Heroku\nHeroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that lets companies build,\ndeliver, monitor, and scale apps. Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and\nscale modern apps. Heroku is fully managed, giving developers the freedom to\nfocus on their core product without the distraction of maintaining servers,\nhardware, or infrastructure.\n\nGo to https://signup.heroku.com/ and signup for an account\nIt will send a verification to your email so make sure you've entered a\nvalid email\n\n\nDownload the Heroku CLI from\nhttps://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install\nWe need to do a small tweak to our app to be ready to be deployed on Heroku.\n\nOn server.js, add the process.env.PORT bit of code\napp.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function() {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\nThis tells our server to look for an environment variable called PORT and\nuse it to run the server, otherwise use Port 3000. When the server runs on\nheroku, then Heroku sets the PORT to the correct value.\ngit add and commit your change.\n\nNow open the command line in the folder where you have your\nexpress-workshop repo running. If you run the command git remote -v,\nyou should see one remote origin pointing to your repo.\n\nRun these commands:\nheroku login\n\nThis will ask you for your heroku email and password that you used to\nregister.\n\nOnce you're logged in:\nheroku create\n\nThe heroku create command creates a new application on Heroku – along with a\ngit remote that must be used to receive your application source.\n\nIf you check git remote -v, you should see a second remote called heroku.\nNow push your code to heroku git push heroku master. The push will run few\ncommands from Heroku, then you should see a url similar to\nhttps://some-random-name-XXXX.herokuapp.com - go to the URL and if all goes\nwell, your app should be up and running.\nTo read more about Heroku and deploying Node Apps to Heroku, check\nhttps://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git and\nhttps://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up\nHomework\n\nDeploy to Heroku if you haven't yet\nAdd a route posts/:postid that displays a specific post - Read about route\nparameters on\nExpress documentation\nWhen the user clicks on a route in the home page, navigate them to your\nroute.\nAmend your JSON structure to have a postId that you can use it to\nidentify which post we want to display.\n\n\nImplement the Admin page.\nWrite a posts endpoint that you can hit and that should save to the JSON\nfile (use the helper functions we added under helpers/savePost)\nMake an AJAX call from the front end (the admin page) to your new\nendpoint.\nYou might need to use formidable or body-parser middleware to get the\ndata on the server.\n\n\nConsume a posts API built by another colleague (and deployed to Heroku) to\ndisplay their latest blog posts. You can display the posts on any page that\nyou see suitable (or add a new page).\nSecure the Admin page so that it's only visible if a certain query parameter\nis provided\nCan you go a bit further with adding proper security?

Follow the instructions for\nyour platform (Windows, Linux or OS X).\nAlso download and install RoboMongo from https://robomongo.org/download.\nOpen two instances of terminal. Run mongod - this will start MongoDB then run\nmongo on the other window.\n\nIn the mongo shell (terminal) - run the command version() and you should get\nthe version of Mongo printed on the terminal\nDatabases overview\n\nDiscussion:\n\nWhat is a database role?\nWhy do we need a database? Why not just use the file system?\nWhat would make a good database?\n\n\nWhy a database?\n\nDatabases can store very large numbers of records efficiently (they take up\nlittle space).\nYou can have strucutre on your data\nYou can query for data in a database, you can sort data, add/edit/delete data\nYou can optimise a database to make searches (queries) quicker\nYou can relate pieces of data to each other to avoid duplication which makes\nyour information more reliable and less prone to errors\nACID\nIn computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is\na set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity\neven in the event of errors, power failures, etc.\n\n\nDatabases can handle very large data sets.\nDatabases are concurrent; multiple users can use them at the same time without\ncorrupting the data.\nDatabases scale well\n\nRelational and non-relational databases\nThere are mainly two flavours of databases used commercially these days.\nRelational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.\nRelational databases include MySQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle\nDatabase and many others. They've been around for a long time and they're used\nfor all kind of applications.\nNon-relational databases are relatively new and they include the likes of\nMongoDB, Casandra, Neo4j etc...\nMongo\n\nMongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database\nprogram. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like\ndocuments.\n\nBSON (JSON-like document)\nIn a Relational database, information is organised in rows in tables with\npredefined columns.\nIn a non-relational database, information is organised in documents. MongoDB\nstores data records in a format similar to JSON called BSON. BSON is a binary\nrepresentation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.\n\nLet's look at this database table Students containing information about\nstudents participating in a course \n\nExercise: What are the columns, rows and tables?\n\n\n\nExercise: Open https://jsonlint.com/ and write a JSON representation of two\nrows in the Students table example. Click Validate JSON and make sure the\ndocument is valid.\n\nAre there any alternative representations you can think of?\n\n\nBSON is very similar to JSON. It contains more data types than JSON, it also\nallows the field names to not be quoted. Read more information about the\nformat - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/.\nMongo Shell\nLet's go to mongo shell and start interacting with our database system.\n1. create a database\nOn the shell, type the command use profile The shell should respond with\nswitched to db profile. At this stage, the database does not necessarily\nexist once we start adding information (collections) then the database will be\ncreated and the collection added to them.\nTo check the current database, run db.\n2. create a collection\nNow let's create our first collection. Make sure you're using the profile\ndatabase. Run db and it should print profile on the terminal.\nWe will insert a simple document representing a student.\n\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Habiiba', country: 'Somalia', assignedMentors:\n['Ashleigh'] })\n\nYou should get a confirmation with the number of records inserted.\nYou can also insert more than one document at a time. Run this command\n\ndb.students.insertMany([{ name: 'Khalid', country: 'Yemen' }, { name:\n'Yohannes', country: 'Ethiopia', assignedMentors: ['Michael'] }])\n\nrun the command db.students.count() and you should get that you have 3\ndocuments.\n3. Querying data\nQuerying is one of the most important reasons that we use databases. SQL is the\nlanguage used for querying relational databases, In MongoDB, we can use the\nmethod db.collection.find, passing a query in the form of a JSON object as a\nfirst parameter.\nLet's try few queries:\nGet all the students from Ethiopia.\n\ndb.students.find({country: 'Ethiopia'})\n\nWe can also provide an extra parameter projection to define what fields we\nwant back from the query.\nFor example, if we're only interested in the name\ndb.students.find({ country: \"Ethiopia\" }, { name: 1 });\n// you can also use { name: true }\n\nLet's add another two students to the collection\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Sudan', assignedMentors:\n['Michael'] })\nand\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Syria', assignedMentors:\n['Michael', 'Ashleigh'] })\nNow let's query for all the students that have Michael as mentor.\ndb.students.find({ assignedMentors: [\"Michael\"] });\n\nWhat if we want to find any student whose name is \"Mohamed\" AND whose country is\n\"Sudan\". You can then use the logical query operator $and.\ndb.students.find({\n  $and: [{ name: \"Mohamed\" }, { country: \"Sudan\" }]\n});\n\nNotice that name and country are case-sensitive.\nExercise:\n\nFind all students for whom Ashleigh is an assigned mentor.\nFind all students that have Michael as their only mentor\nFind students whose name is Mohamed OR Michael is their only mentor\nRead about the\n$in operator\nand use it to find students whose country is either Sudan or Ethiopia.\nLook at the other\nComparison Query Operators\nand the\nLogical Query Operators\nand use few of them.\n\nKey Concepts so far\nIn Mongo, a database contains collections that contain BSON\ndocuments. We can use the mongo shell to interact with our Mongo\ndatabases. The query documents are used to specify a selection filter using\nquery operators\nto search for documents in the collections.\n\nCheckpoint: Do you understand all the words highlighed in the last paragraph?\n\nNode with Mongo\nSo far we've been connecting to Mongo using the Mongo shell. Mongo has drivers\nfor most major programming languages but it's especially popular with NodeJS\napplications as its API and Query model is very close to JavaScript syntax and\npatterns.\nLet's start wiring Node with MongoDB as a datastore.\n\nFork and Clone the project\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop.\nrun npm install then npm run dev to run the application with autoreload -\nGo to the browser and make sure it's up and running.\n\nInstall the MongoDB Node.js Driver npm install mongodb --save\n\nLet's add an endpoint api/students that returns a json containing all the\nstudents that we've been saving to the database from the shell.\n\n\nGo to the file controllers/apiController, on top of the file, require the\nmodule\nconst MongoClient = require(\"mongodb\").MongoClient;\n\nthen add an endpoint for /students\nrouter.get(\"/students\", (req, res) => {\n  const mongoConnection = \"mongodb://localhost:27017/profile\";\n\n  MongoClient.connect(mongoConnection, (err, db) => {\n    const cursor = db.collection(\"students\").find({});\n    cursor.toArray((error, students) => {\n      db.close();\n      res.json(students);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nGo to your browser /api/students and you should see a JSON containing the\ndocuments we've added to the students collection earlier.\n\nExercise: Let's step through the previous code and understand it line by line.\n\nWhat is a Mongo conection string?\n\n\n[Connection String documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/) - The connection string follows this format: `mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]` - what parts do you have in our connection string right now?\nExercise\nNow let's change the api/posts to also use the mongo database instead of the\njson file under /data.\n\nFirst step is to save the posts in the database. Similar to what we did\nwith students collection, use the Mongo shell to create a new collection\ncalled posts and use insertMany to insert all the documents.\n\nChange the endpoint /api/posts to read its contents from the database (very\nsimilar code to what we wrote in /api/students endpoint). Go to\nhttp://localhost:3000/api/posts and make sure you see the posts. Update a\ndocument in the database (either check the documentation for\nupdate\nor use RoboMongo) and see if it gets reflected.\n\nOnce you have the endpoint running, delete the json data/posts.json.\n\nNow if you go to the root of your application http://localhost:3000, you\nwill encounter an error as it will still try to read from the file system but\nwe deleted the file. Update the / endpoint to also get the Posts from the\ndatabase.\n\n\nExercise Part 2: Refactor the code\nEven though our code does what's supposed to do, it has several issues. We have\na lot of duplicate code - both endpoints GET /api/posts and GET / do the\nsame call to the database and then do something with it. It's only that\nsomething (the callback) that is different so let's refactor the code to\neliminate duplication (DRY).\n\nThe variable mongoConnection is declared multiple times, that means that if\nthe connection string changes then we need to change multiple places causing\npossibilities of missing one instance and causing errors. Let's declare it\nonce and use it in the rest of the app.\n\nWhy is it bad to have duplicate code?\n\nExtract the Mongo calls to seperate functions. Extract the route for\n/api/students into a function named getStudents\n\nWhat will the function signature be?\n\nRemember the Single Responsibility Principle - the route handlers have\nmultiple responsibilities right now: Connecting to Mongo, getting the data\nthen sending it back as a response.\n\nMove the new function to a new file called helpers/db-client.js, export the\nfunctions and use them in the original file.\n\nDo you remember how we create modules and use them? module.exports and\nrequire.\n\nDo the same for the /posts\n\n\nExercise Part 3: Deploy our app\nLet's deploy our Database-Driven Application to Heroku. If you don't remember\nthe steps, refresh your memory from\nthe previous lesson.\nOnce you're finsihed, Go to your application on heroku and see if it is working\nproperly.\nIt should not be working.\nCan you have a guess on what went wrong? To see what's happening on the heroku\nserver, run heroku logs from the terminal and check the logs.\nMongo on Heroku\nHeroku, AWS and other cloud services allows us to use databases and other\nservices on the cloud without having to maintain physical servers making it easy\nto scale, monitor costs and build good solutions in general.\nWe've already used DynamoDB on AWS. This week, we'll do MongoDB.\n\nGo to Heroku dashboard\nhttps://dashboard.heroku.com\n\nClick on your app name in the dashboard. Go to Resources, under addons,\nsearch for mLab MongoDB and choose it. When you're prompted with this\nscreen - click on Provision.\n\n\n\nThe new MongoDB service will appear under Resources - you can click on it and it\nwill take you to a web interface to administer your MongoDB instance.\n\nGo to the Settings and click on Reveal Config Vars. You should see the\na variable called MongoDB_URI - that is the connection string for the MongoDB\ninstance on Heroku (on mLab used by Heroku).\n\n\nSo how can we use this connection string instead of our local one?\n\nEnvironment variables\nIn NodeJS, The process.env property returns an object containing the user\nenvironment. Environment variables allow us to configure different aspects of\nour application based on the environment where it's running - so for instance,\nwhen we run our application locally, we want to connect to the local MongoDB but\non Heroku, we want to connect to a different one.\nConnection strings are typically saved and used as Environment variables, other\ntypical uses are with passwords, secrets, URLs of other services etc... Anything\nthat is environment specific and that shouldn't live in the source code.\n\nSecurity tip: Never add passwords, connection strings or any sensitive\ninformation in your source code, always use an Environment variable.\n\nServices like Heroku and AWS can then use these environment variables to\nconfigure aspects of the application.\n\nWe've already used one Environment variable for Heroku before - what was it?\nExercise: Use the environment MongoDB_URI to connect to MongoDB on Heroku,\nbut fallback to localhost connection string if there is no environment\nvariable provided.\n\n\nCommit and push the changes to Heroku and see if it works.\n\nHomework\nRefer to the MongoDB/Node workshop for the Homework tasks -\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop\n\nRead https://www.upguard.com/articles/mysql-vs-mongodb\n\nResources\n\nWhy use a database\nDatabases and Collections\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/\nDocuments in MongoDB - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/\nPractice on a web Mongo shell\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb_terminal_online.php\nEnvironment Variables -\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/working-with-environment-variables-in-node-js.html\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sql-comparison/\n\n"},"others/making-a-pull-request.html":{"url":"others/making-a-pull-request.html","title":"Making a Pull Request","keywords":"","body":"Making a Pull Request\n\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nWhy fork?\nWhat is a remote?\nHow to fork a GitHub repo\nAdding a remote\nCreating a PR\n\nWhy fork?\nFor many of the CodeYourFuture homework assignments, you will need to make a Pull Request to a GitHub repository. By default GitHub repos prevent most people from pushing to them. This is ensure that repo owners have control over the project.\nThis doesn't mean you will never be able to make changes to the repo! On GitHub you do this by creating a \"fork\". A fork is an exact copy of the original repo but copied to your own GitHub account. This means that now you can push to it!\nThis is why you will need to create a fork when submitting a PR for your homework.\nWhat is a remote?\nGit has a concept of a \"remote\". These are other git repositories that can be connected to over the internet. You can push or pull code changes from them. Remotes have a name and a URL. Most of the remotes that you will use at CYF are hosted on GitHub, so have a github.com URL.\nWhen you clone a repo from GitHub, the default remote is named origin and the URL is set to that of the GitHub repo.\nYou can view the remotes you have set up with:\ngit remote -v\nHow to fork a GitHub repo\nFirstly you need to click the \"Fork\" button:\n\nThen you should be brought to your new fork (notice how the repo title changes):\n\nNow you can clone from your fork by copying the URL here:\n\nThe command to clone is:\ngit clone URL_YOU_JUST_COPIED\nAdding a Remote\nFollow these instructions if you are getting an permission error when pushing your changes. If you have cloned the original repo before forking, you'll need to follow these instructions. You can check this by running git remote -v. If the output looks something like:\norigin git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/css-skin.git (fetch)\norigin git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/css-skin.git (push)\nthen you have cloned before forking. The key is that the origin remote is pointing to a CodeYourFuture URL. Don't worry, we can fix it!\nThe first step is to fork the original repo. Follow the first 2 steps from forking instructions above.\nNow, instead of cloning the fork (you have already cloned), you need to add it as a remote. \nRun:\ngit remote add fork URL_YOU_COPIED_FROM_FORK\nThis will add a new remote called fork that points to your new fork. To check this, run git remote -v again. You should see both the origin and fork remotes.\nNow that you have your fork remote you can push to it (instead of the origin remote, which will error) by running:\ngit push fork\nYou'll need to remember to add the fork every time you push.\nCreating a PR\nSo you've done your homework, you've committed your changes and are ready to make a PR. Congrats! &#x1F389;&#x1F389;&#x1F389;\nAt this point you should have followed the instructions either to fork the original repo or added a remote to your fork. If you haven't make sure you read those sections first.\nYou will need to push to your fork. If you forked and then cloned (as in the how to fork instructions) then you just need to run git push. If you added a remote to your fork, then you will need to run git push fork.\nNext you need to go the original repo in your browser (probably starting with https://github.com/CodeYourFuture).

Tie into the idea of how in a\nprogram these would be the ‘tools’ required for an activity and how for our\nsandwich making task the items we have listed previously are our classes\n\n\nNow that we have all of the tools we need to make a sandwich ask the students\nto shout out what they think the first step or instruction is:\nWrite the instruction out on the screen and ask the students which object\nwould be needed to carry out that instruction\nCopy the instruction and place it under the object that the students have\ndecided is responsible for it and introduce the idea of methods\nContinue asking the students for instructions and listing them under the\nobjects that would be responsible for them (in the case where two objects\nare required to carry out an instruction try and break it down further with\nthe students until only one object is responsible for any one instruction –\ncould be a good way to introduce the idea of how specific you need to be in\nprogramming and the concepts that are detailed in the source example of\nthis exercise)\n\n\nOnce the students are satisfied with the instructions take the best formed\nclass and ask the students to come up with a one word summary for each\ninstruction that is has. Explain the benefits of well named methods in\nprogramming and (maybe?) touch on naming conventions.\n\nGetting started with JavaScript\nWe will spend most of this lesson in Codepen. To get started, go to\ncodepen.io/pen/ to create a new Pen. On the bottom left,\nclick the \"Console\" button to open the console.\n\nYou can place your cursor right behind the > sign. Type a simple expression,\nsuch as 2 + 2 and hit enter. You will see expression, as well as its result,\nin the window above.\n\nYou will be able to follow most of this session along just entering expressions\nin the console like this.\nVariables and assignments\nFor an expression or a value to be of any use to us, we need to store it in a\nvariable.\nVariables have a name (identifier) that we can use to refer to a value. You\ncan assign a value to a variable with the following statement:\nvar x = 3;\n^   ^ ^ ^\n|   | | value\n|   | assignment operator\n|   identifier\ndeclaration statement\nLet’s break this statement down:\n\nvar: With the var statement we tell the JavaScript engine that x is now\na variable\nx: The variable name/identifier. It can be short or long, but must not\ncontain spaces and must not start with a number.\n=: The equal sign is the assigmnent operator\n3: The value that we assign to the variable. This can be any number, string\nor boolean, or any more complex data type that we will introduce later. You\ncan also use an existing variable here.\n;: THe semicolon is not strictly needed, but is generally used to terminate\na statement.\n\nNow you can use the identifier instead of the actual value in an expression:\nx + x, x * x, console.log(x)\nSimple data types & Expressions\nNumbers\nLet’s start with something seemingly simple - numbers. Here are some:\n1;\n15;\n3195803798;\n1.4;\n0.0000005;\n0 - 23;\n\nYou will see that there are whole numbers (no decimal point) and real numbers\n(decimal point), which in JavaScript are so-called “floating point” numbers.\nNumbers can be positive or negative and they support all the basic math\noperators that you would expect:\n2 + 2; // 4\n2 - 5; // -3\n2 * 3; // 6\n10 / 2; // 5\n3 * -2; // -6\n\nOperators have the same precedence as in algebra: * and / have higher\nprecedence than + and -.\n\nTODO: Do math exercise\nTODO: What about Infinity, Math.PI, IEEE floating point bullshit, NaN\n\nStrings\nStrings represent any sort of text. They are delimited by single quotes (') or\ndouble quotes (”) and can be of any length.\n'' // empty string\n\"\" // empty string\n'Hello'\n'I am learning JavaScript'\n'It\\'s been a great journey so far!'\n\"Double quotes work as well\"\n\nIf you need single or double quotes inside the string, you need to “escape”\nthem by putting a backslash in front of them. If you don’t do this, the\nJavaScript engine will think the string ends here, because it encounters a\nquote.\n\nThe most common operation on strings is to append one string to another. This is\ncalled string concatenation. It’s achieved by the plus (+) operator:\n\"Hello\" + \"World\" // \"HelloWorld\"\n\nTODO: Introduce string concatenation\nTODO: What about basic string functions, like substr, replace etc?\n\nBooleans\nBooleans are a data type that\ncan only have two values: true and false.\nLike numbers, they can be combined using operators, but there are different\noperators for booleans (analoguous to\nBoolean algebra). The most\nimportant ones are:\n\n! (NOT), which negates a value:\n\n!true; // false\n!false; // true\n\n\n&& (AND), which is only true if both operands are true:\n\nfalse && false; // false\ntrue && false; // false\nfalse && true; // false\ntrue && true; // true\n\n\n|| (OR), which is true if at least one of the operands is true:\n\nfalse && false; // false\ntrue && false; // true\nfalse && true; // true\ntrue && true; // true\n\nTODO: When to introduce truthiness and falsiness? Probably in comparisons?\n\n\nExercise: Put simple mathematical expressions into the console: 2 * 2,\n2 + 2, 5 * 7 - 13 > Exercise: Calculate the area of a circle (r * r *\npi). Do a quick Google search on how to use PI in JavaScript.\nSee what happens when you \"add\" two strings together\nResearch the JS Math library. sqrt, floor, ceil, round\nWrite an expression that outputs the percentage of students who are female.\nMake it so it outputs it as 58%, and make sure you use the actual numbers of\nwomen and the total number of students. Solution: console.log(Math.round(7 /\n17 * 100) + \"%\");\n\nFrom REPL to console.log\n\nSingle expressions are not very useful, you want to write applications\nMore than one statement? Move it to the JS box in Codepen\nNow you don't get any immediate feedback\nUse console.log to print to the console: console.log(3 + 3);\nWrite statements below each other\n\n\nTHOUGHT: Codepen does not have a \"run\" button, so it's quite intransparent\nwhen it actually re-runs a program. Maybe a different tool is better? A simple\njsbin configuration, maybe?\n\n"},"house-rules.html":{"url":"house-rules.html","title":"House Rules","keywords":"","body":"House Rules\n\nWhilst you're a student, arrive on time. Lots of people are giving freely\nof their time and knowledge to make the class possible and giving up other\ncommitments to be here.

We are hosted by\ngenerous folks who are offering their space (and time) to help us - the least\nwe can do is to keep their space tidy and clean, and consider it our own.\n\nCommunication is key (and in English). Setup Slack on your phone and\ncomputer, and use it all the time to ask and provide help, enquire about the\nclasses etc... Also, the classes help lots of the students (and volunteers!)\nto improve their English as a nice side effect, so even if you share a\nlanguage with some of the participants, resist the temptation and speak in\nEnglish!\n\nLearn to find answers. A big part of what we teach you is about\nresearching and finding answers by yourself - get in the habit of Googling and\nfinding answers to your questions.\n\nAlways be in control of the keyboard and mouse. Don't let the mentors take\ncontrol of your keyboard and mouse, don't let them type for you, ask for help\nbut do things yourself!\n\nHelp each other. As students, you're the most qualified to help each\nother, as you're going through the same journey of learning - offer and ask\nfor help from your fellow students (helping someone else is also one of the\nbest ways to improve your own skills)\n\nWe are a community.
