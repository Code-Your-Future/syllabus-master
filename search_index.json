is the course material for Code Your Future, a\nnot-for-profit volunteer-run coding school for refugees and asylum seekers.\nDuring the course you will learn a technology stack that helps you build anything from a simple website to a powerful database-driven web application or even a mobile app! The six-months course starts with HTML/CSS then core JavaScript, backend development using NodeJS, and modern front-end development with React. We’ll complement the training with workshops on modern software methodologies and job interview practices etc...\nContributing\nPlease refer to our contributing guidelines for instructions on how to add or update a lesson.\nTo view this syllabus, visit https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master\n"},"week0/lesson0.html":{"url":"week0/lesson0.html","title":"Week 0","keywords":"","body":"\nLesson 0\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nCodeYourFuture\nWelcome task\n\n\nCodeYourFuture\n\nWho we are?\nWhat we learn?\nRead this Technology Survey from StackOverflow. Pay particular attention to the technologies we'll be teaching you (JavaScript, React, NodeJS)\n\n\nHouse Rules\nHow we work?\nHow we treat each other?\n\n\nStandup\n\nWelcome!\nWelcome to CodeYourFuture and to the world of Web Development! Now that you have built\na website in CodePen and learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it's time to learn about\nthe tools that web developers use in their everyday job. These tools will be used during\nthe course, so it is important that you become familiarised with them.\nIn order to get started, we would like you to try to complete a task at home: move your\nCodePen website to a web address under https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name.\nIn the process, you will learn how to store your code outside CodePen's website, in a location\nwhere other developers can make changes to it and view a history of all the updates that\nyou have made.\nIf you wish to learn more about the concepts behind the steps we are suggesting below,\nplease read the rest of this document.\nAnd remember: it's ok if you are stuck and don't know how to continue. At any point, please\nask for a mentor's help. We will cover these steps again in the lesson, and will explain\nthem in more detail.\nHow to move your website to Github.io\n\nExport your website as a zip from CodePen. Help >\nExtract the contents of the zip file to a folder in your computer.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.\nIt allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

Tie into the idea of how in a program these would be the ‘tools’ required for an activity and how for our sandwich making task the items we have listed previously are our classes\n\n\nNow that we have all of the tools we need to make a sandwich ask the students to shout out what they think the first step or instruction is:\nWrite the instruction out on the screen and ask the students which object would be needed to carry out that instruction\nCopy the instruction and place it under the object that the students have decided is responsible for it and introduce the idea of methods\nContinue asking the students for instructions and listing them under the objects that would be responsible for them (in the case where two objects are required to carry out an instruction try and break it down further with the students until only one object is responsible for any one instruction – could be a good way to introduce the idea of how specific you need to be in programming and the concepts that are detailed in the source example of this exercise)\n\n\nOnce the students are satisfied with the instructions take the best formed class and ask the students to come up with a one word summary for each instruction that is has. Explain the benefits of well named methods in programming and (maybe?) touch on naming conventions.\n\nGetting started with JavaScript\nWe will spend most of this lesson in Codepen. To get started, go to codepen.io/pen/ to create a new Pen. On the bottom left, click the \"Console\" button to open the console.\n\nYou can place your cursor right behind the > sign. Type a simple expression, such as 2 + 2 and hit enter. You will see expression, as well as its result, in the window above.\n\nYou will be able to follow most of this session along just entering expressions in the console like this.\nVariables and assignments\nFor an expression or a value to be of any use to us, we need to store it in a variable.\nVariables have a name (identifier) that we can use to refer to a value. You can assign a value to a variable with the following statement:\nvar x = 3;\n^   ^ ^ ^\n|   | | value\n|   | assignment operator\n|   identifier\ndeclaration statement\nLet’s break this statement down:\n\nvar: With the var statement we tell the JavaScript engine that x is now a variable\nx: The variable name/identifier. It can be short or long, but must not contain spaces and must not start with a number.\n=: The equal sign is the assigmnent operator\n3: The value that we assign to the variable. This can be any number, string or boolean, or any more complex data type that we will introduce later. You can also use an existing variable here.\n;: THe semicolon is not strictly needed, but is generally used to terminate a statement.\n\nNow you can use the identifier instead of the actual value in an expression:\nx + x, x * x, console.log(x)\nSimple data types & Expressions\nNumbers\nLet’s start with something seemingly simple - numbers. Here are some:\n1\n15\n3195803798\n1.4\n0.0000005\n0\n-23\n\nYou will see that there are whole numbers (no decimal point) and real numbers (decimal point), which in JavaScript are so-called “floating point” numbers. Numbers can be positive or negative and they support all the basic math operators that you would expect:\n2 + 2 // 4\n2 - 5 // -3\n2 * 3 // 6\n10 / 2 // 5\n3 * -2 // -6\n\nOperators have the same precedence as in algebra: * and / have higher precedence than + and -.\n\nTODO: Do math exercise\nTODO: What about Infinity, Math.PI, IEEE floating point bullshit, NaN\n\nStrings\nStrings represent any sort of text. They are delimited by single quotes (') or double quotes (”) and can be of any length.\n'' // empty string\n\"\" // empty string\n'Hello'\n'I am learning JavaScript'\n'It\\'s been a great journey so far!'\n\"Double quotes work as well\"\n\n\nIf you need single or double quotes inside the string, you need to “escape” them by putting a backslash in front of them. If you don’t do this, the JavaScript engine will think the string ends here, because it encounters a quote.\n\nThe most common operation on strings is to append one string to another. This is called string concatenation. It’s achieved by the plus (+) operator:\n\"Hello\" + \"World\" // \"HelloWorld\"\n\n\nTODO: Introduce string concatenation\nTODO: What about basic string functions, like substr, replace etc?\n\nBooleans\nBooleans are a data type that can only have two values: true and false.\nLike numbers, they can be combined using operators, but there are different operators for booleans (analoguous to Boolean algebra). The most important ones are:\n\n! (NOT), which negates a value:!true // false\n!false // true\n\n\n&& (AND), which is only true if both operands are true:false && false // false\ntrue && false // false\nfalse && true // false\ntrue && true // true\n\n\n|| (OR), which is true if at least one of the operands is true:false || false // false\ntrue || false // true\nfalse || true // true\ntrue || true // true\n\n\n\nTODO: When to introduce truthiness and falsiness? Probably in comparisons?\n\n\nExercise: Put simple mathematical expressions into the console: 2 * 2, 2 + 2, 5 * 7 - 13\nExercise: Calculate the area of a circle (r * r * pi). Do a quick Google search on how to use PI in JavaScript.\nSee what happens when you \"add\" two strings together\nResearch the JS Math library. sqrt, floor, ceil, round\nWrite an expression that outputs the percentage of students who are female. Make it so it outputs it as 58%, and make sure you use the actual numbers of women and the total number of students.\nSolution: console.log(Math.round(7 / 17 * 100) + \"%\");\n\nFrom REPL to console.log\n\nSingle expressions are not very useful, you want to write applications\nMore than one statement? Move it to the JS box in Codepen\nNow you don't get any immediate feedback\nUse console.log to print to the console: console.log(3 + 3);\nWrite statements below each other\n\n\nTHOUGHT: Codepen does not have a \"run\" button, so it's quite intransparent when it actually re-runs a program. Maybe a different tool is better? A simple jsbin configuration, maybe?\n\n"},"html-css/":{"url":"html-css/","title":"HTML/CSS","keywords":"","body":"HTML & CSS\nExample structure:\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\n\n\n\n\n1\nSemantic HTML tags  CSS Selectors  CSS Cascades  Pseudo Classes  Box model\n\n\n2\nResponsive web design  Media queries  Content Layouts\n\n\n3\nDesign frameworks  Naming patters  Forms  CSS processors\n\n\n\n"},"html-css/semantic-tags.html":{"url":"html-css/semantic-tags.html","title":"Semantic HTML tags","keywords":"","body":"Semantic HTML tags\nWhat makes a web page?\n\nSeparation of Concerns: In computer science, separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern.

Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.\n\nSemantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look.

How is the object-oriented naming pattern used here?\n\nLet's look at the following example of Bootstrap's Card component:\n\n    \n        Card title\n        Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n    \n\nWe have three types of class names here:\n\n.card is the object.\n.card-block, .card-title, and .card-text are sub-objects.\n.card-inverted is a modifier.\n\nWith Bootstrap's naming pattern, we know an object is a single word class name like .card, .btn or .alert. But our other two types of class names share the same naming pattern: .card-inverted and .card-block.\nThe Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) naming pattern is an attempt to overcome this. It introduces separate naming structures for all three types of class names.\n\nThe object is called a \"Block\": .card.\nThe sub-objects are called \"Elements\" and are written with 2 underscores: .card__block, .card__title and .card__text.\nThe modifier is written with 2 dashes as: .card--inverted.\n\nIf we changed our Card example to use BEM syntax, it would look like this:\n\n    \n        Card title\n        Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n    \n\n\n\"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things\" - Phil Karlton\n\nOne of the goals in a naming pattern is to communicate purpose.\n"},"html-css/forms.html":{"url":"html-css/forms.html","title":"Forms","keywords":"","body":"HTML Forms\nForms provide tools for visitors to your webpage to interact by entering details, making selections or performing other actions.

You also have to give a name to your variable, which can be anything you like, so long as it doesn't include spaces.\nHere's an example of creating a variable called \"city\", which is storing a string called \"Glasgow\".\nvar city = 'Glasgow';\n\nconsole.log(city);\n\nYou'll notice that once you've created the variable, you can then simply write the name of the variable wherever you want to refer to it, rather than writing out Glasgow every time.

So far we have been logging the same thing every time we run the code, but what if we want to log according to different conditions? In programming there is something called an \"if/else statement\". It tests conditions, and will perform different actions based on the outcome of these tests.\nThe structure of an if/else statement in JavaScript is as follows:\nif (condition) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nIt basically translates to \"if this condition is true, do this - or else do something else\".\nTry it out\nWhat if we want to console.log() \"Hello world!\" if we're feeling happy, and something else if we're sad?\nLet's define a variable called isHappy, and assign it a boolean value of true or false (depending on how happy you're feeling).\nvar isHappy = true;\n\nThen let's write our if/else statement. In our condition, we want to test if the variable isHappy is equal to true. Note that in JavaScript, to test if two things are equal you need to use a triple equals (===) rather than just one (=).\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nNow let's add in what will happen if the conditions are met. The comments are there to explain what is happening.\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // if I am happy, print \"Hello world!\"\n  console.log('Hello world!');\n} else {\n  // if I am sad, print a frowny face\n  console.log(':(');\n}\n\nNow run this code and see what happens! Try changing the value of your variable from true to false.\n\nExercise\nWrite an if/else statement that evaluates if a number is even or odd. If it is even, it will print the string 'even', and if it is odd, it will print 'odd'.\nFor this challenge, you might find it useful to use the \"modulo\" operator, which looks like this: %. The modulo operator finds the remainder after division of one number by another. For example:\n13 % 2 === 1 // 13 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1\n100 % 10 === 0 // 100 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 0\n\nExercise\nNow improve your code so that it prints out if the number is positive or negative, as well as even or odd. For example, for -5 it will print 'negative odd', while for 4 it will print 'positive even'.\nHint: You can use the > or  signs.\nIf you finish early, think about how you would test your code works correctly?\n\n"},"js-core/for-loops.html":{"url":"js-core/for-loops.html","title":"For loops","keywords":"","body":"For Loops\nCoding is great because it makes it easy to automate boring tasks, like writing the same thing over and over again. A \"for loop\" lets you do that in JavaScript. \"For loops\" let you perform the same operation a certain number of times, each time with a different value.\nA for loop has the following syntax:\nfor (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nStatement 1 defines a variable for the loop and assigns it a starting value. It is usually a number, which will increase each time the loop completes an iteration. We can use this number inside the loop to keep track of where we're at. You can set the number to be whatever you want initially.\nvar i = 0;\n\nStatement 2 defines how long the loop will go on for (what needs to happen for the loop to stop running?). It most often uses the less than () or less than or equal to () operators to set the length.\ni \nStatement 3 defines by how much to increment the i variable each time the loop completes an iteration. If you just want it to increase by one, then put i++, or else you can increase by other numbers like so:\ni += 2\n\nInside the square brackets goes the code you wish to be executed each time the loop runs. You can refer to the variable i from inside the loop.\nTry it out\nHere's an example of an actual for loop that prints out the numbers 1 to 10:\nfor (var i = 1; i \nNotice the variable i is set to 1, because we want counting to begin there.

Arrays are to the rescue!\nImagine an array like a list or a collection of variables, but instead of each variable having its own name, only the array has a name. So how do you access a variable inside, then? How do you read and write? Using an index!\nAn index is just a whole number, such as 0, 1, 2 and so forth. As in many areas of computing, indices in JavaScript arrays start with 0 --- so 0 is the index of the first element of an Array, 1 is the index of the second element, and so forth.\nThe syntax is to list the values separated by commas, inside square brackets:\n[value1, value2, value3]\n\nYou can store any type of value inside an array: strings, numbers, booleans. You can even store other arrays, or objects (which you will learn about next).\nTry it out\nDefining an array as a variable looks something like this:\nvar animals = [\"tiger\", \"puppy\", \"snake\", \"llama\"];\n\nPretty neat! Now you have all the animals grouped together rather than having to define them separately. You can see how many animals there are by using .length:\nconsole.log(animals.length);\n\nIf you want to refer to one specific member of the array, you can do so by using their \"index number\" like so.\nconsole.log(animals[1]);\n\n\nTake a guess at which animal that will print out, and see if you're right.\n\nSpoiler alert, it will print out \"puppy\". That might seem weird, until you learn that JavaScript is a \"0-index\" language. What that means is that counting in JavaScript starts at 0. So animals[0]will print out \"tiger\". We don't make the rules...\n\nExercise:\n\nCreate an array that contains the countries of all the students in the class (at least five nationalities)\nconsole.log the number of countries in the Array\nNow, console.log() each country in the list.

Google skills are an essential part of being a developer.\n\nUseful array methods\nConcatenating two arrays\nYou've learned how you can add two numbers and append two strings, but how does this work for arrays? A simple arr1 + arr2 will not do, but there is a method you can use: concat(). It is a method that you call on the array (similar to how console.log is the log function called on console) and takes the array you want to append as a parameter.\nvar countries = ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria'];\nvar moreCountries = ['Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France'];\n\ncountries.concat(moreCountries);\n\nAppending an element\nIf you want to append an element to an array, you can just put it after the last existing element like so:\ncountries[countries.length] = 'United States of America';\n\nThere is another way though, which is a bit more elegant: the push function.\ncountries.push('United States of America');\n\n// .push can also be called with multiple parameters\ncountries.push('United States of America', 'France');\n\n\nExercise: Google .slice, .splice, .push and .pop.\n\nUse .push to add another country to your country array.\nUse .pop to remove the last two countries.\nUsing .push, add enough countries to your array so that countries.length is 10. Now use .slice to return the first 3 countries from the array.\nUse .splice to remove the two countries at index positions 5 and 6.\nUse .splice to add a new country at index position 2.\n\nExercise (advanced)\n\nGoogle the .map and .filter methods.\nCreate an array of numbers.

For example, you might want to save the name, model and colour of a car. Or the name, time and location of a film playing at the cinema.\nThere are several ways to write objects. Object literals (literal notation) look like this:\n{\n  property1: \"value1\",\n  property2: \"value2\",\n  property3: \"value3\"\n}\n\nThe names on the left (\"property1\") are known \"keys\". Any values can be given to them: strings, booleans, integers.\nTry it out\nLet's define an object that represents a person:\nvar person = {\n  firstName: \"Nelson\",\n  lastName: \"Mandela\",\n  occupation: \"freedom fighter\",\n  age: 95,\n  alive: false\n};\n\nWe can console.log() the entire object, but you can also reference just one of the properties. Run this code:\nconsole.log(person.firstName);\n\n\nExercise\nUsing an object representing a person, console.log() a sentence introducing the person. Print out the following:\n\"Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName}. I am {age} years old, and work as a {occupation}.\"\nHint: you can construct longer strings by adding them together. This includes variables. For example:\nvar name = \"Jane\";\nconsole.log(\"People call me \" + name);\n\n// the previous line will print\n// \"People call me Jane\"\n\n\nObject Constructors\nWe can also use the object constructor syntax to make a new object.

But what if we swap the positions of var a and the console.log()?\n  var firstFunction = function() {\n    console.log(a);\n\n    var secondFunction = function() {\n      var a = 10;\n    }\n\n    secondFunction();\n  };\n\n  firstFunction();\n\nThis returns an error: ReferenceError: a is not defined. You might think that the problem is that we're trying to console log a before it's declared in the code order. So let's try putting the console.log(a) after secondFunction, where a is assigned:\n  var firstFunction = function() {\n\n    var secondFunction = function() {\n      var a = 10;\n    }\n\n    console.log(a);\n\n    secondFunction();\n  };\n\n  firstFunction();\n\nWait, we're still getting the ReferenceError! Even if we move the console.log(a) underneath where secondFunction is called, we still get the error. What's going on?\nWhat we're seeing here is the effect of scope. Take a look at the following diagram:\n\nWe can see from this picture that each function is like a 'bubble', and it has access to the variable assigned within it, and the variables assigned 'above' it, in it's surrounding function. But note that the 'global' scope doesn't have access to var o, and function outer() doesn't have access to var i. So each function can access the variables in its parent scope, and in it's own, immediate scope, but it cannot see the variables in its child scope.\nIf a variable is declared outside of a function, in the 'window', it has 'global' scope. The scope within a function is 'local' scope:\n  var test = \"I'm global\";\n\n  function testScope() {\n    var test = \"I'm local\";\n\n    console.log (test);     \n  }\n\n  testScope();           // output: I'm local\n\n  console.log(test);     // output: I'm global\n\n"},"js-core/closures.html":{"url":"js-core/closures.html","title":"Closures","keywords":"","body":"Closures\nA closure is an inner function that retains access to its parent function's scope.\nIt can be used to emulate private properties\nfunction car(){\n  var speed = 0;\n\n  return {\n    faster: function(){\n      var topSpeed = 12;\n      speed += 5;\n\n      if(speed > topSpeed) speed = topSpeed;\n    },\n    getSpeed: function(){\n      return speed;\n    }\n  };\n}\nvar golfCart = car();\ngolfCart.faster();\ngolfCart.faster();\ngolfCart.faster();\nconsole.log(golfCart.getSpeed());\n\nBoth faster and getSpeed functions retain access to the parent scope and thus the variable speed. While the function car returns both of those functions, it does not expose the variable speed directly. We can only access it using those functions essentially making it a private. It is a useful pattern to restrict access to certain variables and ensure that they can only manipulated via set functions. We can use these functions for example to ensure that only valid values are set.\nClosures can also be used to create factories which can retain configuration and be invoked later.\nfunction carFactory(make){\n  return function(){\n    return {\n      make: make\n    };\n  };\n}\n\nvar fordFactory = carFactory('Ford');\nvar car = fordFactory();\nconsole.log(car);\n\nPlease note how fordFactory does not receive any params. Instead it retains access to its parent scope and is able to refer to the parameters the parent was called with. Most importantly it retains access to the parent scope event after the parent function has returned.\n\nExercise:\nCreate an outer function that accepts one parameter greeting (such as 'Hello', 'Hi' or anything else you like)\nand returns a closure which accepts one parameter name and retuns the greeting including name.

Also, if you're only passing one argument into the arrow function, you don't need to use brackets around the parameter:\n  multiplyByTen = num => { return 10 * num };\n\n  console.log(multiplyByTen(5));\n\nIf you're only going to return a single line in an arrow function, you don't even need the curly brackets (or the return keyword):\n  greet = name => `Hello, I am ${name}!`;\n\n  console.log(greet('Ada Lovelace'));\n\nHowever, there are some important differences between arrow functions and ES5 functions aside from syntax. Try the following exercise:\n  const ourClass = {\n    members: ['Raymond', 'Adis', 'Flavia', 'Nabil', 'Kiya'],\n    className: 'London Class 2',\n    classSummary: function() {\n      return this.members.map(function(member) {\n        return `${member} is in ${this.className}`;\n      });\n    }\n  };\n\n  console.log(ourClass.classSummary());\n\nThe above code doesn't quite work. We've got an object, the ourClass object, and within it, and array, a string and a method. But this.className is returning as undefined - the code isn't seeing what we're trying to point it to.\nLet's try with an arrow function:\n  const ourClass = {\n    members: ['Raymond', 'Adis', 'Flavia', 'Nabil', 'Kia'],\n    className: 'London Class 2',\n    classSummary: function() {\n      return this.members.map((member) => {\n        return `${member} is in ${this.className}`;\n      });\n    }\n  };\n\n  console.log(ourClass.classSummary());\n\nWith that one little change, the function is now working. Why? Well, arrow functions differ to ES5 functions in that they make use of something called 'lexical this'. JavaScript is a 'lexical' programming language; this means that how the code behaves depends on the order or placement of each piece of code. When we use an arrow function, the value of this is bound to the surrounding context. So unlike when we used the anonymous function in the ES5 version(this.members.map(function(member) {), the arrow function lets the JavaScript engine know where this is pointing to.\nIf this is confusing, don't worry; we're going to move onto this in greater depth shortly. But first, let's do a few exercises with arrow functions.\n\nExercise:\nUse JSBin for today's exercises.\n\nWrite an arrow function that returns the string, Hello, I am ${name}, and I am ${age} years old.\nWrite an arrow function that takes an array of integers, and returns the sum of the elements in the array. Google and use the built-in reduce array method for this.\nThe syntax of this function is wonky. Can you fix it to use the shortest arrow function possible?\nlet eye = \"eye\";\n\nconst fire =\n(\n\n) =\n>\n{\n return `bulls-`;\n}\n\n\nRefactor the following ES5 function to use an arrow function:const fibonacci = function(n) {\nif (n \n\n\n\n"},"js-core/context.html":{"url":"js-core/context.html","title":"Context","keywords":"","body":"Context\nWhen a function is invoked, it receives the parameters that were passed in as well two other objects\n\narguments - an array-like object which lists all the parameters which were pass into function\nthis - is an object that refers to the current execution context\n\nWhat the actual object this refers to will depend on how the function was called.\nconstructor\nA function called using new operator is called a constructor.

When a function is invoked as a method this will refer to the parent object.\n  var library = {\n    numberOfBooks: 0,\n    addBooks: function(books){\n      this.numberOfBooks += books;\n    }\n  }\n\n  library.addBooks(7);\n  console.log(library.numberOfBooks) //7\n\nfunction\nA function which does not belong to a method will have its context set to the global object, which is window in the browser and global in Node.\nThat causes several issues.\n\nInner functions cannot see the context of parent methods\nvar library = {\n numberOfBooks: 0,\n addBooks: function(books){\n   this.numberOfBooks += books;\n\n   function double(){\n     this.numberOfBooks *= 2;\n   }\n\n   double();\n }\n}\n\nlibrary.addBooks(5)// 5\nconsole.log(library.numberOfBooks);\n\n\n\nThis is because double is a function and it gets passed the global object as the value of this.\n\nWhen a method is called a function we lose our original scope because this becomes window rather than the parent object.\nvar library = {\n numberOfBooks: 0,\n addBooks: function(books){\n   this.numberOfBooks += books;\n }\n}\n\nvar detached = library.addBooks;\ndetached(7);\nconsole.log(library.numberOfBooks) // 0\n\n\n\nAlso, your global object has now acquired a numberOfBooks property which is not ideal :(\nWe can resolve this in two ways.\n\nUse a temporary variable to capture this which will remain visible to the inner function\nvar library = {\n numberOfBooks: 0,\n addBooks: function(books){\n   var that = this;\n   this.numberOfBooks += books;\n\n   function double(){\n     that.numberOfBooks += books;\n   }\n\n   double();\n }\n}\n\nlibrary.addBooks(5) // 10\nconsole.log(library.numberOfBooks);\n\n\nbind the value of this so it is retained. bind is a method of function which returns a function that has this set to the value passed in as a param.\nvar library = {\n numberOfBooks: 0,\n addBooks: function(books){\n   this.numberOfBooks += books;\n }\n}\n\nvar detached = library.addBooks;\ndetached = detached.bind(library);\ndetached(7);\nconsole.log(library.numberOfBooks) // 7\n\n\n\napply / call\nAnother way to invoke functions is using apply or call methods. They both accept the context, the value that will become this as their first param. The difference is that apply takes the params that will be passed into the method as an array, whereas call takes them as individual params.\n  var book = {\n    author: 'JK Rowling'\n  }\n\n  function addTitle(title){\n    this.title = title;\n  }\n\n  addTitle.call(book, 'Harry Potter');\n  console.log(book.title) // Harry Potter\n\n\nExercise\nAbove we solved the issue 1. with internal method double using tempory variable that and we solved issue 2. with detached context using bind.

That means they can be used in a first class manner like any other object since they are objects themselves. We have seen how to assign a function to a variable and return a function from a function. Now we will look at passing functions into other functions and executing them. This is common technique in JavaScript for dealing with asynchronous behaviour. We have in fact already encountered callbacks when we looked at array methods such as .forEach(), .map() or .filter\nconst evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];\nevenNumbers.forEach(function( num ) {\n    console.log(num);\n});\n\nHere we are passing the function( num ) {console.log(num);} function as an argument to .forEach() to execute with each item in the array evenNumbers.\nfunction x(y){\n    return y + 1;\n}\n\nfunction z(a, callback){\n    return callback(a);\n}\n\nconst out = z(57, x);\nconsole.log(out);\n\nThe above example is synchronous which means that code the callback is executed immediately. Let's look at an example where the code is executed asynchronously. We will use a setTimeout function to delay execution here. In most JavaScript applications asynchronous code execution could be in response to an event such as mouse click or data coming back from a server. We will at both of those cases in detail at a future class.\nfunction delay(callback){\n    setTimeout( callback, 2000 );\n}\n\nfunction logRandom(){\n    const value = Math.round( Math.random() * 10);\n    console.log( value );\n    return value;\n}\n\ndelay(logRandom);\n\nKey points\n\nFunctions can be passed as arguments to other other function\nFunctions that are passed as arguments are called callbacks\nCallbacks may be executed immediately or later\nIf callback is executed later, its return value is lost\n\n\nExercise\nCreate a function called double which will accept one number as its input parameter, multiply it by 2 and return the result. Pass the double function as an argument to the .map() method of numbers below to multiply apply function to each item in the number array.\nconst numbers = [ 6, 8, 18, 10 ];\n\nfunction double /* create rest of the function */\n\nconst output = numbers.map(/* pass the double function here*/);\n\nconsole.log( output );\n\n\nPure functions\nA function is considered a pure function if it does not depend on or modify state outside of its scope. In other words, it will always output the same result given same inputs and will not produce any side effects.\n// Pure function\nfunction( a, b ){\n    return a + b;\n}\n\n// Not a pure function since output value will vary with each call\nfunction( a, b ){\n    return b * Math.random() + a ;\n}\n\n// Not a pure function because it has changed the value outside its scope\nfunction double( in ){\n    in.value *= 2;\n}\n\nconst myObject = {value: 10};\n\ndouble(myObject);\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThe result of pure functions can be cached.

Once the repo is cloned run npm install from inside it to install the dependency libraries.\nUnit testing is a substantial topic. There are many books written about it and many in-depth discussions online. Here we try to focus on the some of the core aspects, but please note that there will be more content than we may not cover here.\nWhat are some of the aspects of unit tests\n\nUnit tests should ensure the correct behaviour or a small unit of code. In JavaScript that usually refers to a single function.\nUnit tests should be automated.\nUnit tests should be fast to run. That enables them to be run by developers in the background or before each commit and pick up any errors as early as possible. This can hugely speed up software development by correcting issues as soon as they are detected rather than wait til a tester or even worse, a customer, finds them.\nUnit tests should mock any external dependencies such as database calls or network access. This is because those operations can be slow, require a lot of effort to be put into the right state or produce non-deterministic results. For example, your code may be correct but if your test requires internet access and the network is down the test will fail, thus creating a false error.\nUnit tests should be easy to maintain. Because they cover only small parts of the code, they should not be affected by code changes outside of the segment being test.\n\nIt brings a number of benefits to your code\n\nHaving unit tests allows us to make changes to our application with a high degree of confidence. The unit tests should tell us if we broke anything.\nUnit tests make it easy for us to notice when we have broken something in our code. Because each unit test covers a small piece of code, it makes it easy to spot where we broke the code.\nWriting testable code forces us to write small functions, with a clear purpose. That also makes our code easy to understand both by ourselves in future as well as other developers. It results in simpler, cleaner design.\n\nAnother approach to testing is end-to-end. Here you would want to test a whole feature of user journey from start to finish. Starting with a click, it may involve an API call over the internet and make changes in database. While they do provide a value and knowledge that your code is running correct, they also have some drawbacks.\n\nEnd-to-end tests can be slow. It can difficult to keep all layers of the test in sync and as a result the tests may end up being run in series rather than parallel.\nThey can break easily because they cover a large number of steps and may be affected by any changes even if those changes are valid.\nThey can be costly to maintain because any changes in application code may require changes in all tests.\nPutting dependencies such as the database into a known state for each test can be tricky.\n\nJest\nWe will be writing our unit tests using a framework called Jest. It's created by Facebook and useful for all kinds of unit testing (especially testing React, which we will do in a later lesson).\nHow do we write unit tests\nLet's look at the anatomy of a unit test.\nfunction sum(a, b){\n    return a + b;\n}\n\ntest('adds', () => {\n  const result = sum(1, 2);\n\n  expect( result ).toBe( 3 );\n});\n\nEach unit test will have the following parts.\nCode to be tested\nThis will usually be a function. Even if we are testing a large object we will usually do so one function at a time.\ntest\nThis is a function which will carry out our test. It expects 2 parameters.\n\nA string describing what we are testing\nA callback that will contain the actual test codematcher\nThis is the part that compares the output of the function being tested with expected outcome. This is a series of chained function calls starting the function expect which takes the result of the execution as its parameter and returns an expectation object with lots of methods that we can use to validate our result.\n\nThe details of all of them are available at [https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html]\n\nOur old friend closure revisited\nfunction expect( result ){\n    return {\n        toBe: function( expected ){\n            validate( result === expected );\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n.toBe() performs a === comparison. Works great for primitives such as strings, numbers and booleans. Fails when comparing objects and arrays because === will check if they refer to the same memory location, not their actual values\nconst a = {b: 'c'};\nexpect(a).toBe({b: 'c'}); // false\n\nTo compare actual values of an object we need a function that will iterate over all of the values making sure they all match.\nconst a = {b: 'c'};\nexpect(a).toEqual({b: 'c'}); // true\n\nWe can also check the opposite of a match by inserting a .not property into our call chain to invert the result of a matcher.\nconst x = {y: 1};\nx.y++;\nexpect(x).not.toBe({y: 1}); // true\n\nThere are dozens of matching functions available. Please refer to the Jest documents for details.\nSingle test execution\nYou will often have fairly large test suites and you may want to isolate one specific test. You can do so by appending the .only() method to the test object. Hence your test will look something like\ntest.only('this will be the only test that runs', () => {\n  expect(true).toBe(false);\n});\n\n"},"js-core-2/modules.html":{"url":"js-core-2/modules.html","title":"Modules","keywords":"","body":"Modules\n\nThis is a bit of an advanced topic at this point. Don't worry if you don't understand all of it - we are going to pick up modules again in a later lesson!\n\nSo far, all our programs have been in their own single files. But Node programs can become really large, and having all our code in only one file will not be maintainable.\nWe can therefore split our code into so-called modules. A module is basically a JavaScript file that makes its functionality available to other modules and programs.\nCreating modules, exporting code\nIt is really simple to take existing JavaScript code and turn it into a module by exporting its functionality:\nfunction printName(name) {\n  console.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = printName;\n\nThe key here is the line containing module.exports. As you see, this is an assignment, and whatever is assigned to module.exports will be made available to other modules and program when this file is imported.\n\nTogether: Let's do this: Edit the file test/sum.test.js and export the function defined there into src/sum.js\n\nUsing modules, importing code\nBut how do we make use of another module in our program? We need to import it, and this is done using a function called require().\n\nThere are different module formats for JavaScript. The one we are using here, which is natively supported by Node, is called CommonJS.\n\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\n\nThe string passed to the require() function is a path to the file you are importing. ./ signifies the current directory, so the above command will import a file called \"printName.js\" that is in the same directory as our program.\n\nAssuming our program is in the same folder as printName.js, we can use the above code to import the functionality provided by that module and store it in the printName variable.\nWe can then continue to use the printName function as if it we defined it in our own program!\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\nprintName();\n\n\nModules can not only export functions, but all variable types you already learned about. Most commonly, they export a function or an object containing multiple functions.\nTogether: Import src/sum.js into test/sum.test.js and run the test\n\nSeparating code and tests\nExporting and importing modules is really useful for testing, too.\nAs a rule of thumb, we never want to mix our actual code with our tests. It is therefore common to put them in separate files. We are going to call the file containing the tests after the file containing the code to be tested, just appending .test at the end of the filename. Like so:\nsum.js                # Our main program\nsum.test.js           # Tests for our main program\nsomeOtherCode.js      # A module called \"someOtherCode\"\nsomeOtherCode.test.js # Tests for the \"someOtherCode\" module\n\nThe naming is really up to convention - you can even put your tests in a different folder! However, for Jest it is important to call test files \"*.test.js\".\nExercise: Edit test/sum.test.js. Move the actual sum function to a different file (src/sum.js) and export it from there. The go back to your test file and import the sum function from sum.js.\nExercise: Run npm test function inside unit-testing-london. We have 10 failing tests.\n\nTo begin with export the functions object from src/functions.js and import it into test/functions.test.js.\nImplement all the functions in src/functions.js so all the unit test pass when you run npm test function. Do not make remove or change any tests in test/functions.test.js.\nCreate a function src/functions.js that accepts 2 arrays as arguments and returns a new array which contains all the items from the two inputs.

It involves ignoring the characteristics that we don't care about in order to concentrate on those that we do care about.\n\nSource: http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zttrcdm/revision\n\nExercise: http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zttrcdm/test\n\nAbstraction is a technique for arranging code into different levels of complexity. At the highest level is code that can be easily understood by a person. At the very lowest level is binary code and electric signals (e.g. 00101010110) that can be understood by computer hardware. There are many levels of abstraction in between, so programmers don't have to interact with details of the system that are not revelant to them (such as how the programming language works, or how memory gets allocated).\nSo far, in the solutions we wrote, we think in terms of steps: DoStep1, DoStep2, DoStep3 until we solve a problem. We're thinking in the Verbs that constitute a solution. Our abstractions are functions that do things to reach a solution. We can use a function without knowing how it works (think about console.log()) - the abstraction of that function hides the complexity of how console.log actually works.\nNow we will step into a new level of abstractions - Object Oriented Programming (OOP).\n\nThe basic idea of OOP is that we use objects to model  things that we want to represent inside our programs, and/or provide a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.\n\nOO overview\nDefining an object template (classes)\n\nIn OOP we create templates for objects that we will create. These are often called classes.\nCreating actual objects (instances)\n\nFrom a class we can create (or instantiate) an object. This process is called instantiation.\nSpecialist classes\n\n\nExercise: On a paper, let's model  our class - what classes do we have, what objects, what properties do they have, can we create any specialised classes?\n\nObject literals\nThere are several ways to create objects - we've already used one before. It is called object literals\nvar person = {}\nThe line before created an empty object. Let's create a more sophisticated object\nvar person = {\n    name: ['Simon', 'Muong'],\n    age: 32,\n    gender: 'male',\n    interests: ['javascript', 'html'],\n    greeting: function() {\n        alert('Hi! I\\'m ' + this.name[0] + '.');\n    }\n};\n\nSo what is going on here? Well, an object is made up of multiple properties, each of which have a name (e.g. name and age above), and a value (e.g. ['Bob', 'Smith'] and 32). Each name/value pair must be separated by a comma, and the name and value in each case are separated by a colon. The syntax always follows this pattern.\nThe value of an object member can be pretty much anything — in our person object we've got a string, a number, two arrays, and two functions. The first four items are data items, and are referred to as the object's properties. The last two items are functions that allow the object to do something with that data, and are referred to as the object's methods.\n\nMethods are functions that allow the object to do something with its data.\nThe this keyword refers to the context when the method is called. In this case, when calling person.greeting() - the context is person, so this refers to that person object. this is a much more complicated and confusing topic in JavaScript but we will get back to it again and again.\n\nAn object like this is referred to as an object literal — we've literally written out the object contents as we've come to create it. This is in contrast to objects instantiated from classes, which we'll look at next.\n\nExercise: write this Person object that we just implemented. Add a method called printBio that prints the interests of that person.\nExercise: create another object for a different person with the same methods but different data (different name, interests etc...)\n\nConstructor functions\n\nExercise: Let's create a function called createPerson that takes a name as a parameter and returns an object.\n\nSome programming languages will have a class keyword that allows programmers to create that Template of an Object.\nJavaScript, instead, uses special functions called constructor functions to define objects and their features. They are useful because you'll often come across situations in which you don't know how many objects you will be creating; constructors provide the means to create as many objects as you need in an effective way, attaching data and functions to them as required.\nLet's look at how constructor functions work.\nfunction Person(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.greeting = function() {\n        alert('Hi! I am ' + this.name + '.');\n    };\n}\n\nThis is the template that defines what a Person should look like. Now let's create a specific object, an instance of Person.\nvar sally = new Person('Sally');\nconsole.log(sally); // { name: 'Sally': greeting:  }\nconsole.log(sally instanceof Person); // true\n\nYou'll see the this keyword is being used. What exactly is it doing? When the constructor function is called, this is a reference to the object it creates (its instance). In our example we add a property (name) and a method (greeting) to this so whenever Person is instantiated it returns an object with a name property and a greeting method.\nYou'll also notice that the constructor function take a parameter, name (which is getting passed to Person when it is instantiated in the example above). When Person is instantiated the name parameter is assigned to the name property of the instance (this.name = name) as well as being used to configure the greeting method.\n\nSome people argue that JavaScript is not a true object-oriented language — for example, it doesn't have a class statement for creating classes, unlike many OO languages. JavaScript, instead, uses special functions called constructor functions to define objects and their features. They are useful because you'll often come across situations in which you don't know how many objects you will be creating; constructors provide the means to create as many objects as you need in an effective way, attaching data and functions to them as required.\nExercise: Let's add another property to that Person called gender that will take either 'male' or 'female' as values (these will be passed as parameters same as name).\nExercise: add a method called displayInfo that will print the person's name with 'Mr' or 'Ms' depending on the gender of the Person.\n\nResources\n\nMDN Objects basics\nMDN OOP in JS\n\n"},"js-core-2/dom.html":{"url":"js-core-2/dom.html","title":"The DOM","keywords":"","body":"The DOM\nYour webpages are made up of a bunch of HTML elements, nested within each other (parents and children). In JavaScript we have access to this \"DOM\" object (Document Object Model) which is actually a representation of our webpage that JavaScript can work with.\nHere are two examples, HTML and then JavaScript, of how the DOM might look like:\n\n    \n         Welcome! \n         Hello world! \n    \n\n\nvar document = {\n    body: {\n        h1: \"Welcome\",\n        p: \"Hello world!\"\n    }\n};\n\nIn the browser the DOM is represented by the window.document object, which can also be accessed directly using document. We can use it to get information about the page loaded into the browser, query the content of the page and edit it. You can see full details of the functionality at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document .\nQuerying\nThe DOM offers a lot of useful functions we can use to find elements on the page. Here are some we'll be using today:\nelement = document.getElementById(id);\n\ngetElementById accepts an id string as argument and returns an Element from the document with a matching id. If no matching Element is found the function returns null.\nelements = document.getElementsByClassName(names); // or:\nelements = rootElement.getElementsByClassName(names);\n\ngetElementsByClassName takes a string containing one or more classes and returns an HTMLCollection, which is an array-like object containing all elements whose class attributes match the string. We can pass multiple classes as an argument to query for elements matching all classes.\ngetElementsByClassName('green bike')\n\nAbove call will return elements that have both the green and bike classes.\ngetElementsByClassName can be called on individual elements as well as the top-level document object. When calling getElementsByClassName on an element, the method will query only the children of the element rather than the entire document\nelements = document.getElementsByTagName(name); // or:\nelements = rootElement.getElementsByTagName(name);\n\nMuch like getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName allows us to query for elements using the tag name. getElementsByTagName also returns HTMLCollection and can be called on elements as well as document.\nAll of the above calls return a live reference, which means that the objects will be automatically updated with all changes since the query.\n\nExercise:\n\nClone the repo from HTML and CSS class into new bikes directory.  git clone git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/bikes-for-refugees.git bikes\nCreate an index.js file in src folder inside the bikes repo.\nPut the following code in the index.js file: alert('hello'); to check the file is being loaded\nImport the index.js file into index.html by placing  just before the closing body html tag.\nOpen index.html in your browser.\nIn index.js:\nUsing getElementById, getElementsByClassName or getElementsByTagName ...\n... get the element with id donation-count-alert and console.log it. Look up documentation for Element or use a debugger find and console.log the contents of the element.\n... get all elements with the class btn, loop over them and console.log them individually. You may need to look up documentation for HTMLCollection.\n... get all links inside the element with id navbarSupportedContent, loop over the collection and console.log the text inside each link\n\n\nQuery selector\nThe above selector functions are available in all browsers, but can be somewhat inflexible for example in situations that require complex lookups. Modern browsers have\ndocument.querySelector('#mainHeader');\ndocument.querySelectorAll('p');\n\nBoth .querySelector and querySelectorAll accept a CSS selector as an input.\n.querySelector selects only the first element it finds, querySelectorAll selects all elements and returns a NodeList, which is a collection of Nodes (not an array). Unlike the selectors in the previous section, these functions return static results. That means any changes in the DOM will NOT result in updates to the elements.\n\nExercise:\n\nComment out the code from previous exercise and rewrite solutions using querySelector and querySelectorAll. You may need to look up documentation for NodeList.\n\n\nDOM manipulation\nWe can use the DOM to edit elements. For example the textContent property of elements can used to read as well as set the text contents of an element.\nvar x = document.querySelector('.jumbotron h1');\nconsole.log(x.textContent) // Bikes for Refugees\nx.textContent = \"Something else\";\n\nSimilarly, innerHTML property of elements can be used to get the HTML content of an element as well as\nvar x = document.querySelector('.jumbotron h1');\nx.innerHTML = `${x.textContent}`;\n\nWe can also access the style property of elements and update various properties\nvar elements = document.querySelectorAll('.btn-primary');\n\nelements.forEach( element => element.style.backgroundColor = 'red' );\n\nPlease note the use of camelCase style attribute names\nWe can also check it exists, read, change and remove attributes of elements using hasAttribute, getAttribute(), removeAttribute and setAttribute\nvar elements = document.querySelectorAll('a');\n\nelements.forEach( element => {\n  if( element.hasAttribute('href') ){\n    var href = element.getAttribute('href');\n    console.log(href);\n    element.setAttribute('href', 'https://google.com');\n  }\n});\n\nWhat will above code do?\n\nExercise:\n\nUse above functions to\n... place - around the text in the navbar links\n... convert links in 'Upcoming Events' section to italic using  tag\n... make 'Learn more` links green\n\n\nCreating and inserting elements\nWe can use document.createElement(tagName) method to create a new element and document.createTextNode(text) to create new text contents. The elements created can be manipulated just like the elements above, but the changes will not visible until we insert the new element into the DOM.\nWe can insert elements into other elements using element.appendChild or element.insertBefore. For example.\n\n    some content\n\n\nvar spanNode = document.createElement('span');\nvar textNode = document.createTextNode('hello');\nspanNode.appendChild(textNode);\n\nvar parentNode = document.getElementById('parent');\nparentNode.appendChild(spanNode);\n\nWhat do you think above code will do?\ninsertBefore is a bit more complicated.\nvar insertedNode = parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode);\n\nHere insertedNode is the the node being inserted, that is newNode. parentNode is the the parent of the newly inserted node. newNode is the node to be inserted and referenceNode is the node before which newNode is inserted.\nThere is no insertAfter method. It can be emulated by combining the insertBefore method with nextSibling property. In the line below we use this approach to insert nodeOne after nodeTwo inside parentNode\nparentNode.insertBefore(nodeOne, nodeTwo.nextSibling);\n\n\nExercise:\n\nUse the inspector to examine the navbar\nCreate a new navbar item for Code Your Future which links to https://codeyourfuture.co/\nInsert it at the end of the navbar\n\n\nResources\n\nDocument\n\n"},"js-core-2/events.html":{"url":"js-core-2/events.html","title":"Events","keywords":"","body":"Browser events\nBrowser events are actions that take place on our web page. They could be user triggered such as a mouse being clicked, a key being pressed or a form submitted. Alternatively, they could be triggered by the system such as a resource being loaded or an error occurring.\nWe can subscribe to those events using by registering an eventHandler to perform a certain action when an event is detected. For example, we may want to update a letter count on a text input when a user types or we may want to perform validation on a form before submitting it.\nFor each event subscription we will need 3 things.\n\ntarget - this is the object where we are listening for events on. For example, it could be a link on which we would like to listen to for clicks.\neventType - as the name suggests, this is the type of event we ar listening for. There are dozens of possible events (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events for full list). Common ones include\nclick - mouse click\nsubmit - form submit\nkeydown - keyboard key being pressed\nmouseenter - a mouse cursor being moved onto an element\nchange - value of a form input changing\n\n\neventHandler - A function that we want to execute when the event is detected\n\nTo subscribe to the actual event we use the addEventListener method of our target element like below\nvar myButton = document.querySelector('#myButton');\nmyButton.addEventListener(\"click\", alertSomething);\n\nfunction alertSomething() {\n    alert(\"Something\");\n}\n\nIn the above code myButton is the target on which we listen to for click events and call the event handler alertSomething when the click is detected.\n\nExercise:\n\nSet a click listener on the donate buttons and increment the donated bikes counter with each click\n\n\nEvent object\nJust knowing that an event has happened is not particularly useful in most cases. Usually, we will want to know more about what exactly happened such as the coordinates of a mouse click or the new value of an input after it has changed.\nKeep in mind that different event types will have characteristics that are specific to them. For example, key events will have a event.char property indicating the key that was pressed. mouse events will have event.clientX and event.clientY properties indicating the location of the mouse event on the screen, where (0,0) is the top left hand corner in the browser.\nEvery event object has event.preventDefault() which when called will prevent the default action of the event from being triggered. This is particularly useful to intercepting events and altering the behaviour when needed. For example, we can call event.preventDefault() on a submit event if the data in the form is not valid.\nWe can find out which element the event was triggered on from the event.target property.\n\nExercise:\n\nPrevent clicks on links from triggering a url change in the browser and instead console.log the coordinates of the click as well as the text inside the link\n\n\nBubbling\n\nTogether:\n\nLet's place a click listener on the .jumbotron element and console.log the event\nWhat happens when we click on the buttons?\n\n\nMost events, though not all, have a default behaviour know as bubbling which results in events being propagated to the target element's parents. That means an event listener placed on the parent will be triggered after the event listener placed on the child. Why is this behaviour desired?\nWe can distinguish between the elements on which the event was triggered vs the element on which the event was detected.\n\nevent.target is the element on which received the initial event\nevent.currentTarget is the element on which the event listener detected the event\n\nIn some cases we may want to prevent an event from bubbling up. We can do so by calling the stopPropagation method on the event. Once it has been called, any event handlers placed by parent elements will not be triggered.\n\nExercise:\n\nPlace a single event listener on the body of the document\nconsole.log the text inside each linked clicked, but perform no action for clicks originating from inside the jumbotron.\n\n\nResources\n\nIntroduction to browser events\nEvents\n\n"},"js-core-2/ajax.html":{"url":"js-core-2/ajax.html","title":"AJAX","keywords":"","body":"AJAX\nWhat's a server?\nA device or program that provides functionality to other programs or devices. There are database servers, mail servers, game servers, etc.\nThey can take the form of industrial server farms that provide a service to millions of users (used by Facebook, Google, etc.), to personal servers for storing your files.\nThe server communicates with clients. Clients can be a web browser, a Slack app, your phone, etc.\nClient–server systems use the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgement.\n\nAn example: We can use the Slack app (the client) to put our messages or pictures on Slack. The content is stored on the Slack servers and other clients can then also access the pictures.\n\nHTTP requests\nA server stores the data, and the client (other programs or computers) requests data or sends some of its own. But how do they talk to each other?\nFor the client and the server to communicate they need an established language (a protocol). Which is what HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is for. It defines the methods you can use to communicate with a server and indicate your desired actions on the resources of the server.\nThere are two main types of requests: GET and POST.\n\nWith a GET request you can ask for specified resource (e.g. show me that Slack photo).\nWith a POST request you can send content to the server to be appended to the web resource (e.g. post a photo on Slack).\n\nHTTP is the language of the internet. In our case we're using Javascript, but you can send HTTP requests with other laguages as well.\nAJAX (= Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)\nAJAX is a set of useful methods for implementing client-server communication.\n\nAJAX just uses a combination of:\n\n\nA browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)\nJavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)\n\n\nAjax works behind the scenes, helping the webpage communicate with the server (with GET and POST requests).\n\nclient ----------GET request----------> server returns data to client\nclient ----------POST request (with content)--------->server updates data with content\n\nThe server holds the data, but it only sends it to the webpage when there's a request. The request can be sent after the page has loaded, for example when a user clicks a button.\nWhy Ajax?\nThere are other ways you can write HTTP requests, such as using Web sockets. What's great about AJAX is that it makes it look like magic! The server and the client communicate effortlessly:\n\nUpdate a web page without reloading the page\nRequest data from a server - after the page has loaded\nReceive data from a server - after the page has loaded\nSend data to a server - in the background\n\nAJAX Example\nThe instant update: we can write code that makes the web page instantly update its contents (without reloading the page).\nLet's try sending some data from Rares’ phone to the server and see whether it will update the webpage.\n\nhttp://zero-point.github.io/\n\nLet's Code!\nHow does the code work?

These are often referred to as dumb components - because they do not process the data in themselves:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Organisation extends Component {\n  render() {\n    const name = this.props.name;\n    const website = this.props.website;\n    return (\n        \n            Name: {name} \n            Website: {website}\n        \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Organisation;\n\n\nProps exercise\n\nJSX: Map Arrays to Components\nWhen working with APIs we often have collections of things in Arrays which we want to map to components.

Even though you have all these methods available to use at your disposal, the only required method is render().\n\nMounting\nThese are called when a component is being mounted on the DOM such as:\n\nConstructor()\ncomponentWillMount()\nrender()\netc\n\nUpdating\nWhen there are changes to the props or state:\n\ncomponentWillReceiveProps()\ncomponentDidUpdate()\nrender()\netc\n\nUnmonting\nWhen a component is being removed from the DOM:\n\ncomponentWillUnmount()\n\nOther APIs\nThese include setState() and forceUpdate(). You cannot access the state in some lifecycle methods, refer to the diagram above to find out which.\nThe complete list of these methods with their descriptions can be found in the documentation here.\nAPI calls\nIn order to make an API called you can call the functions same\ncallAPI = () => {\n    const APIAddress = 'https://code-your-future.github.io/api-demo/area/All/index.json';\n    fetch(APIAddress)\n    .then(function(response) {\n      return response.json();\n    })\n    .then(function(jsonData) {\n      this.setState({ orgData: jsonData });\n    });\n}\n\nIn order to use this function when the component first loads we will call it in the componentDidMount() lifecycle method.\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    this.callAPI();\n}\n\nOnce the state is updated with the data, your component will re-render.\n"},"react/routing.html":{"url":"react/routing.html","title":"Routing","keywords":"","body":"Routing\nReact can be used as a Single Page Application, i.e. providing full experience of an application with many views within one page with several components.\nHowever it is still possible to support routing by associating and displaying different components for different URLs.\nRouting is usually achieved in React with a library such as React Router.

We are hosted by generous folks who are offering their space (and time) to help us - the least we can do is to keep their space tidy and clean, and consider it our own.\n\nCommunication is key (and in English). Setup Slack on your phone and computer, and use it all the time to ask and provide help, enquire about the classes etc... Also, the classes help lots of the students (and volunteers!) to improve their English as a nice side effect, so even if you share a language with some of the participants, resist the temptation and speak in English!\n\nLearn to find answers. A big part of what we teach you is about researching and finding answers by yourself - get in the habit of Googling and finding answers to your questions.\n\nAlways be in control of the keyboard and mouse. Don't let the mentors take control of your keyboard and mouse, don't let them type for you, ask for help but do things yourself!\n\nHelp each other. As students, you're the most qualified to help each other, as you're going through the same journey of learning - offer and ask for help from your fellow students (helping someone else is also one of the best ways to improve your own skills)\n\nWe are a community.

Check that supporting mentors are making sure everybody gets to write and understand code.\nOrganise a group discussion at the end of the class of areas not understood. Encourage short explanations of different students to make sure they followed the class and know what they are doing.\nMake sure people connecting remotely have screen sharing (e.g. using Airtame).\nRequest the mentor of the previous class to include any reading material as preparation for the class.\n\nTeaching methodology:\n\nSpeak slowly and support explanation with visuals, board, screen.\nAsk questions to different students in the class (Note: do not rely on group questions that nobody answers/ same people answer).\nDivide the class in different segments.\nCheck that supporting mentors are helping all students.\nFind simple language to explain, speak slowly, gesture.\nLook for analogies in simple drawings, make use of whiteboard.\n\nTimetable  Example\n\nCode review (let different people present their work, group feedback, good intro to new concepts) @12.30pm ~30mins\nIntroduce New concepts (visual, including non-coding images for each concept) + short practical exercises @1pm ~20mins x 3 \nCoding (working alone and in pairs with longer exercises) ~1.5h – \n(break for lunch around 2.30pm for 30min)\nGroup discussion (what remains unclear) ~15min\nNew assignment explanation ~15mins\n\nAssignments (Homework) Guidelines\n\nIt should include 4 different areas:\nReadings and videos reinforcing the concepts and preparing for the next class (blogs, youtube, chapters of books, etc)\nComplete some online coding tutorials (FCC, sololearn, codewars, etc)\nCreative Coding task (with answers that can’t be found easily online)\nReview each other’s code\n\n\n\nNote: Assignment should be uploaded in the repository before the end of the class and explained in group.\nTips from codebar http://www.codebar.io/effective-teacher-guide\n\nYou don't need a laptop for our workshops. You are there to watch and guide the students. If you don't feel comfortable with the tutorial you should spend time on it before coming if you want to help out.\nDo not take over the keyboard! This can be off-putting and scary.\nEncourage the students to type and not copy paste.\nExplain that there are no dumb questions.\nExplain to students that it's OK to make mistakes.\nAlways introduce yourself. Say why you want to help out and are spending your own time on this, why you like programming.\nGive your students the opportunity to get to know each other. Ask their names, why they are here, what they do in their day jobs. Encourage a brief discussion before starting.\nAssume that anyone you're teaching has no knowledge but infinite intelligence.\nWork collaboratively with your student. If you have two students, you should work with both. Don't focus all your attention on one of them.\nLet students have a go at answering the questions first. Help with open and leading questions. Encourage a discussion.\nTake it slow, you are the teacher, they are the student. Allow for time between questions.\nDon't say no when the students are not doing something right. Be gentle, approach it in a mild way.\nUse pen and paper or go to a whiteboard! Often students are coming from a non-technical background. Drawing and explaining with visual material is really helpful.\nLet them stumble. We learn by making mistakes, getting frustrated, and working through problem in our own way. Be supportive, but let them explore.\n\n"},"lesson-template.html":{"url":"lesson-template.html","title":"Lesson Template","keywords":"","body":"   (have one of these badges on top of your Lessons and follow the guidelines/workflow defined in this issue)\n[Class name]\n What we will learn today?\n\nTopic 1\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nTopic 4\n\n\nTopic 1\nHigh level explanation of Topic 1 - rely on the exercises\n\nExercise: Always have exercises\n\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nResources\n\nResource 1 to learn more about Topic 1\nResource 2 for Topic 2\n\nHomework\n\nFirst part of Homework - Easy\n\nSecond part of Homework - Intermediate/Hard\n\n[Bonus/Optional] Third part/optional - Hardest\n\nResearch:\n\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nRead this Some Tutorial or Video etc...\n\n"}}}
