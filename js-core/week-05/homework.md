# Homework

1. [The repo](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/JS-Core-1-Exercises) that you
   have forked during the last class contains few challenges - solve them all in
   JavaScript. You should know all the needed information by now.

2. Follow
   [this course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming)
   on Khan Academy. It will go through some of the basics that we covered in the
   class and beyond.

3. **Research:**

Read the chapter from JS: The Good parts

* Chapter 9: Style - it's a short chapter, everyone start by reading that
  chapter.
* ALL: Read the chapter about **Objects** (up to Reference)
* Read the chapter about **Arrays** (ignore the Methods section)
* Read the chapter about Functions up to the section about **Return**

When reading always try the code snippets by yourself in Node. (change
document.writeln to console.log)

Next class - we want you to do a presentation (including showing some code
sample) for one of these concepts:

* Switch Statements and Ternary Operators
* Math methods in JavaScript
* While loops (compare them to for Loops)
* Array.slice and Array.splice
* Array.map and Array.forEach
* Array.find and Array.filter
* String.replace, String.search and other String methods
* Object.keys (How to loop the properties of an object)
* [Function arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)
* [Advanced][different ways of creating objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Creating_new_objects)
* [Advanced][inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Inheritance)
* [Advanced][regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)

## Prepare for the next class

1. Reserach **Unit Testing** (next time, know how to answer the question: **what
   is TDD?**)
