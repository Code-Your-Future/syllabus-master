# Arrays

If you want to store a **bunch of things**, a **collection** or a **list** of things,  identifiers like `name1`, `name2`, `name3` and so on quickly become tiresome. **Arrays** are to the rescue!

Imagine an array like a list or a collection of variables, but instead of each variable having its own name, only the array has a name. So how do you access a variable inside, then? How do you read and write? Using an *index*!

An index is just a whole number, such as `0`, `1`, `2` and so forth. As in many areas of computing, indices in JavaScript arrays start with `0` --- so `0` is the index of the first element of an Array, `1` is the index of the second element, and so forth.

The syntax is to list the values separated by commas, inside square brackets:

```js
[value1, value2, value3]
```

You can store any type of value inside an array: strings, numbers, booleans. You can even store other arrays, or objects (which you will learn about next).

## Try it out

Defining an array as a variable looks something like this:

```js
var animals = ["tiger", "puppy", "snake", "llama"];
```

Pretty neat! Now you have all the animals grouped together rather than having to define them separately. You can see how many animals there are by using `.length`:

```js
console.log(animals.length);
```

If you want to refer to one specific member of the array, you can do so by using their "index number" like so.

```js
console.log(animals[1]);
```

> Take a guess at which animal that will print out, and see if you're right.

Spoiler alert, it will print out "puppy". That might seem weird, until you learn that JavaScript is a "0-index" language. What that means is that counting in JavaScript starts at 0. So `animals[0]`will print out "tiger". We don't make the rules...

> **Exercise:**
>
> 1. Create an array that contains the countries of all the students in the class (at least five nationalities)
> 2. `console.log` the number of countries in the Array
> 3. Now, `console.log()` each country in the list. Hint: **For loops**

# Objects

Now for the final data type: objects. Like arrays, they can store multiple bits of information, except objects store the properties of something. For example, you might want to save the name, model and colour of a car. Or the name, time and location of a film playing at the cinema.

The syntax looks like this:

```js
{
  property1: "value1",
  property2: "value2",
  property3: "value3"
}
```

The names on the left ("property1") are known "keys". Any values can be given to them: strings, booleans, integers.

## Try it out

Let's define an object that represents a person:

```js
var person = {
  firstName: "Nelson",
  lastName: "Mandela",
  occupation: "freedom fighter",
  age: 95,
  alive: false
};
```

We can `console.log()` the entire object, but you can also reference just one of the properties. Run this code:

```js
console.log(person.firstName);
```

> **Exercise**
> Using an object representing a person, `console.log()` a sentence introducing the person. Print out the following:
>
> *"Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName}. I am {age} years old, and work as a {occupation}."*
>
> Hint: you can construct longer strings by adding them together. This includes variables. For example:
>
>```js
>var name = "Jane";
>console.log("People call me " + name);
>
>// the previous line will print
>// "People call me Jane"
>```


# Useful array methods

#### Concatenating two arrays

You've learned how you can add two numbers and append two strings, but how does this work for arrays? A simple `arr1 + arr2` will not do, but there is a method you can use: `concat()`. It is a method that you call on the array (similar to how `console.log` is the `log` function called on `console`) and takes the array you want to append as a parameter.

```js
var countries = ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria'];
var moreCountries = ['Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France'];

countries.concat(moreCountries);
console.log(countries); // ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria', 'Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France']
```

#### Appending an element

If you want to append an element to an array, you can just put it after the last existing element like so:

```js
countries[countries.length] = 'United States of America';
```

There is another way though, which is a bit more elegant: the `push` function.

```js
countries.push('United States of America');

// .push can also be called with multiple parameters
countries.push('United States of America', 'France');

```
Then, to make a new _instance_ of the object, we write:

<<<<<<< HEAD
```js
var firstBook = new Book("War and Peace", 1869);
var secondBook = new Book("Twilight", 2005);
```

> **Exercise**

> 1. Make an animal object using the object constructor syntax. The object should have key/value pairs for:
>
 - Name.
 - Family (mammal/reptile/bird etc)
 - Number of legs.
 - eatsMeat (_hint_: what data type can you use to represent a yes/no?)
 - sound

> Then make 5 new instances of the object with different animals.

> 2. A function within an object is called a _method_. Add a method to your animal object called `says`. When you `console.log(dog.says())`, the console should read, 'dog says woof'
