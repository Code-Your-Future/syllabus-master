# Homework

* Finish the tasks from the workshop
* Try adding an `/about` route to your app to serve some HTML. How is this
  different from using express's static middleware? You can see one way of doing
  it [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4529586/render-basic-html-view)
* Complete the nodeschool.io

**Important:** When you get stuck during the homework you should follow the
following "escalation policy".

* First, search for answers on Google and Stack Overflow. If you have an error
  message, copy and paste it into Google.
* When you are stuck for longer than 20 minutes - no longer! - write a question
  to your fellow students in your class channel on slack. Take a while to think
  carefully about the question. This is an important skill. There is a great
  guide to writing good questions
  [here](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
* If you cannot get an answer from your fellow students, @ a mentor with your
  question and we will reply as soon as we can.
