# Recap
What did we do [last time](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/blob/scotland/node-db/lesson2.md)? 
Do you remember anything from our [AWS class](https://github.com/Michael-Antczak/Introduction-to-Amazon-Web-Services)? 

### Exercise 
1. clone [Express workshop 3 project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Express-workshop-3) as a starting point for today
1. replace the title heading with your name
1. start the local server and check in the browser that it all works properly
1. walk through the code, so we all understand what is in there

### Exercise - AMI 
1. make sure you have access to the AWS keys
1. spin up a server using Habiiba's AMI
1. ssh to the server and verify that Node.js is installed
1. go to the IP address in the browser

# Transfering files to server

### Exercise - ftp
1. download [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)
1. open FileZilla
1. setup up a [connection to EC2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16744863/connect-to-amazon-ec2-file-directory-using-filezilla-and-sftp)
1. upload (maybe everything exept `node_modules` folder and the run `npm install` on server)
1. start the server with `npm start`. Does it work? Why not? (Hint: what is the port?)
1. make small changes locally, upload and verify in the browser

# Saving data to file

### Exercise - save new post to file
We want to have an ability to create a new post when we go to `/admin`. When we click `Send` we want to add the new post to `data/posts.json`. Go!

1. add `body-parser` to the project
2. add the following lines inside the `server.js`
    ```js
    app.use(bodyParser.json()); 
    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
    ```
3. go to `admin.handlebars` and change the type of button from submit to just button. Why? 
4. add `id="addPostButton"` to the button
5. create a new JS file inside `js` folder called `add-post.js`
    ```js
    var addPostButton = document.querySelector('#addPostButton');
    addPostButton.addEventListener('click', function() {

        const title = document.getElementById("title").value;
        const summary = document.getElementById("summary").value;
        const contents = document.getElementById("contents").value;

        // create data object
        const postData= {
            title: title,
            summary: summary,
            contents: contents
        }

        // AJAX
        var url = '/admin';
        var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();

        oReq.addEventListener('load', onLoad);
        oReq.open('POST', url);
        //Send the proper header information along with the request
        oReq.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/json");
        oReq.send(JSON.stringify(postData));
    });

    function onLoad() {
        // clear form 
        document.getElementById("title").value = "";
        document.getElementById("summary").value = "";
        document.getElementById("contents").value = "";

        // redirect to main page
        window.location.href = '/';
    }
    ```
6. link the file inside the HTML code
7. add `post` route for `/admin`. This is where we going to process the form data
    ```js
    app.post('/admin', function (req, res) {

        const filePath = __dirname + '/data/posts.json';

        const cb = function(error, file) {
            // we call .toString() to turn the file buffer to a String
            const fileData = file.toString();
            // we use JSON.parse to get an object out the String
            const postsJson = JSON.parse(fileData);
            // add new post to the file
            postsJson.push(req.body);

            // write back to file
            fs.writeFile(filePath, JSON.stringify(postsJson), (err) => {
                if (err) throw err;
                console.log('The file has been saved!');
            });

            res.end("Success.");
        };

        fs.readFile(filePath, cb);

    });
    ```
8. push to server

### Exercise - Handle "Page Not Found"
> Try to navigate to a url that doesn't exist. What do you get? Open the **Developer tools** and check what status code do you get back.

```js
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.status(404).render('404');
});
```

# Persisting Data - Introduction to Databases

What is wrong with the solution above? Why is it not a good idea to save the data to the server's local file? What would happen if you restart the server, or kill it and spin up another one?  Discuss. 

Let's look at the [AWS Database](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/) section. What types of data storage can you see? What are the main two groups?

## Using [DynamoDB with our Express app](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/gettingstartedguide/GettingStarted.NodeJs.html)

What is [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)? What is the price? Where to find docs?   
Watch the video [Introduction to Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/getting-started/)

If you have not finished the last exercise, here is the repo that you can use as a starting point: [Express with saving](https://github.com/Michael-Antczak/Express-workshop-3)  
Use commit b1c85fb8cc97290e6eaef8971f5620b21c2b8e77

### Exercise - Create table in DynamoDB
1. login to the AWS console and create table DynamoDB. Problems? Why? 
1. create a table with a name: **cyf-{username}-posts**
1. look at the structure of our posts in `posts.json`. We will use `title` as primary key
1. add sort key and use `summary`. Click `Create`
1. try to add an item to the table in the console. Use `Items` -> `Create Item`. How to add `content`? 
1. try to add few more posts

### Exercise - Read posts from DynamoDB
We want to change the code in our app inside the `\` to read posts from DynamoDB. How do we do that? 
We are going to use AWS SDK for this. 

1. run `npm install --save aws-sdk`
1. [load credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-json-file.html) - create in the root of the project a file called `config.json`add your access and secret keys
    ```js
    {
        "accessKeyId": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
        "secretAccessKey": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
        "region": "eu-west-1",
        "endpoint": "https://dynamodb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com"
    }
    ```
1. add AWS to the project
    ```js
    // Load the SDK for JavaScript
    const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

    // Load credentials and set region from JSON file
    AWS.config.loadFromPath('./config.json');
    ```
1. now we need to change the route to the root of our project to get the data from Dynamo
    ```js
    app.get('/', function (req, res) {

        var docClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

        var params = {
            TableName: "cyf-student-posts",
            ProjectionExpression: "title, summary, content",
        };

        console.log("Scanning posts table.");
        docClient.scan(params, onScan);

        function onScan(err, data) {
            if (err) {
                console.error("Unable to scan the table. Error JSON:", JSON.stringify(err, null, 2));
            } else {
                // print all the posts
                console.log("Scan succeeded.");
                
                // Here you can test how to access the posts, not needed for the functionality to work, so could be deleted
                data.Items.forEach(function(post) {
                console.log(
                        post.title + ": ",
                        post.summary, "- content:", post.content);
                });

                res.render('index', {
                    title: "Michael's profile",
                    subheading: "A modern Website built in Node with Handlebars",
                    posts: data.Items
                });
            }
        }
    });
    ```

Discussion: do you think this is a good way to read the posts? If not, why not? How can it be done differently? 

### Exercise - Write posts to DynamoDB
If you have not finished, you can use the Express app and checkout the commit: 2e4722ac2828da8f6b00d9e63727e9116a08efbd   
We now have to find a way to write our new posts from the app to the DynamoDB. How can we do that? What needs to be changed? 

1. we need to change the POST behaviour to the `/admin` endpoint
1. remove the code from this route and just add `console.log(req.body)`. Try it out
1. add to the route 
```js
app.post('/admin', function (req, res) {

    // Create the DynamoDB service object
    var docClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

    var params = {
        TableName: 'cyf-student-posts',
        Item:{
            'title' : req.body.title,
            'summary' : req.body.summary,
            'content' : req.body.contents,
        }
    };

    // Call DynamoDB to add the item to the table
    console.log("Adding a new item...");
    docClient.put(params, function(err, data) {
        if (err) {
            console.error("Unable to add item. Error JSON:", JSON.stringify(err, null, 2));
        } else {
            console.log("Added item:", JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
        }
    });

});
```
1. change `add-posts.js` behaviour to redirect to the main page, since we don't really wait for any reply from the server

# Express Generator

Link to the tutorial https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html

# Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object, `req`, the response object, `res`, and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code
- Make changes to the request and the response objects
- End the request-response cycle
- Call the next middleware function in the stack

> **Exercise**: We've already used one built-in middleware in our app - what was it?

## Setup an error handler
You define error-handling middleware in the same way as other middleware, except with four arguments instead of three; specifically with the signature (err, req, res, next):

```js
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
})
```

### Let's write a custom middleware
```js
var myLogger = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('LOGGED')
  next()
}

app.use(myLogger)
```

> **Exercise**: Follow the tutorial for writing `requestTime` at https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html and add it to your own application

# Homework
You can use this as a starting point - https://github.com/Michael-Antczak/Express-workshop-3
1. Exercise - Handle "Page Not Found"
2. Walk through the code again and make sure you understand what it does
3. if you have time you can try to expand on the My CV project that we worked on today:
    a) sort posts alphabetically
    b) when the new post is added to the database, send an email to yourself about that (edited)
