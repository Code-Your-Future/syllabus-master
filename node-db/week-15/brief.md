# CYF Hotel

**Brief**: Designing a hotel website

**Client**: CYF Hotels Ltd

**Date**: 28 January 2018

**Facilitators**: CYF Mentors

## Introduction

Now that you are almost a full-stack developer, we would like you to make us a website for our imaginary hotel.

Since you have a limited time, there is already an empty boilerplate project for you to take and build on top of.

In keeping with times, we are using the [Lean model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_services) and only developing features that we see necessary for the _Minimum Viable Product (MVP)_.

The core functionality will include:

1. **Customer page** - list customers
2. **Customer search** - get customer information by surname
3.

## Team-work

We need you to work in a team by dividing up the work

| Role     | Responsibility                  | Name |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ---- |
| Backend  | API, data                       |      |
| Frontend | HTML/CSS/Templates (Handlebars) |      |

You can have multiple students per role.

If you can, get a mentor to help provide direction/focus for your team.

## Solution & Deliverables

We would like you to upload your solution using Heroku.

Please also submit your solutions as pull-requests to the project.
