# REVIEW OF COURSE

Potential improvements for next course (teacher's perspective):

- Teach students about ISO dates.
- Make sure escaping is taught correctly.
- Make sure foreign keys are done with sqlite using PRAGMA from the outset.
- Format : in future do lesson, followed by exercise, followed by stretch exercise so faster students don't get bored.
- Make sure installing and setting up and doing most basic exercise combining node and SQL is done on homework time.
- Getting students into the "write sql", "delete .sqlite file" and "run sql" and inspect should be done on homework time
- Put everything on trello up front and keep track.
