## What is an SPA?

With these features in mind, it suddenly becomes a lot easier to build Single Page Applications (SPA). 

SPAs run in the browser and fit in a single web page, providing a similar experience to desktop applications. All the content a page requires is usually downloaded at once (HTML, JavaScript and CSS), in the first initial request, or loaded dynamically as the user is clicking around the page. There are no reloads as you click from one section to the next.
